# BeyondTrust AD Bridge Open

BeyondTrust AD Bridge Open has several goals:

1. Simplify the process of joining non-Microsoft hosts to Active Directory domains.
2. Simplify the management of these hosts.
3. Provide a rich development platform for writing applications in heterogeneous networks.

## Instructions on building pbis-open

The pbis-open build uses makekit (http://bkoropoff.github.io/makekit/)
While the code is portable among a variety of *nix based platforms
(Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and OS X), this build system is
primarily intended for Linux & FreeBSD platforms.

Before you begin, please read over this list of prerequisite development
packages (depending on your Linux distro):

### RedHat/Fedora
* gcc glibc-devel pam-devel flex bison rpm-build rpm-devel popt-devel libxml2-devel autoconf automake libtool

#### Optional packages:
* libglade2-devel - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
* 32bit development tools and libraries for compatibility packages when building on x86_64
  * glibc-devel.i686 libgcc.i686 pam-devel.i686

### Ubuntu
* build-essential fakeroot devscripts debhelper autoconf automake libtool flex bison libpam0g-dev libxml2-dev libpopt-dev

#### Optional packages:
* libglade2-dev - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
* 32bit development tools and libraries for compatibility packages when building on x86_64
  * libc6-dev-i386 gcc-multilib libpam0g-dev:i386
  * ia32-libs - replaced by lib32z1

Note: The default version of awk on some Ubuntu systems has a known bug
which causes it to segfault when attempting to build.  You can work around
this by installing GNU awk:

    sudo apt-get install gawk

See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mawk/+bug/23494 for details

The easiest way to begin a build is to run:

    $ mkdir debug && cd debug
    $ ../configure --debug
    $ make -jXX package  ## where XX is 2x CPU cores

This will build the necessary binaries and libraries and package them up into
DEBs or RPMs in the pbis-open/debug/package/ directory.

If you do not want to install using packages, you can do the following
instead, but be sure to read the note below:

    $ make -jXX
    $ sudo make install

You may view the complete set of configure options by running

    $ ../configure --help

To generate a release tarball, run "build/mkdist" with pbis-open
as your working directory.

Note: When not installing using the local package managers (DEB or RPM),
you will need to start lwsmd and import registry files manually:

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/lwsmd start
    $ sudo bash -c 'for file in /opt/pbis/share/config/*.reg; do \
      /opt/pbis/bin/regshell import $file; \
      done'
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/lwsmd reload

## BeyondTrust AD Bridge Registry Service

The AD Bridge Registry Service (lwregd) is the configuration data store
used by all AD Bridge services. AD Bridge provides several ways to view and
modify the registry settings:
    - /opt/pbis/bin/edit-reg
    - /opt/pbis/bin/regshell

edit-reg allows you to modify registry settings in your preferred text editor.
For example:

    $ sudo /opt/pbis/bin/edit-reg

regshell provides the ability to interactively display and modify settings.
For example:

    $ sudo /opt/pbis/bin/regshell
    > cd hkey_this_machine\\services

    hkey_this_machine\services> dir
    [hkey_this_machine\services]
    [HKEY_THIS_MACHINE\Services\lsass]
    ...

    hkey_this_machine\services> cd lsass

    hkey_this_machine\services\lsass> dir
    Arguments    REG_SZ   "lsassd --syslog"
    Dependencies REG_SZ   "netlogon lwio lwreg rdr"
    Description  REG_SZ    "Security and Authentication Subsystem"
    Path         REG_SZ    "/opt/pbis/sbin/lsassd"
    Type         REG_DWORD 0x00000001 (1)

    [HKEY_THIS_MACHINE\Services\lsass\Parameters]

NOTE: incorrectly configuring the PBIS registry can prevent PBIS from starting
and/or prevent user authentication.  Use caution when modifying existing
settings.

## BeyondTrust AD Bridge  Service Manager

The AD Bridge Service Manager (lwsmd) provides a service control
architecture for starting and stopping all AD Bridge daemons and
drivers based on a dependency graph.

The lwsmd daemon itself is managed using the standard SysV init
script:

    $ /etc/init.d/lwsmd start
    * Starting PBIS Service Manager: lwsmd              [ OK ]

Only the registry service (lwregd) is hard coded to be started
initially.  The user space CLI for managing services is the "lwsm"
utility.

    $ lwsm list
    lwreg       running (standalone: 19415)
    dcerpc      running (standalone: 19453)
    eventlog    stopped
    lsass       running (standalone: 19475)
    lwio        running (standalone: 19438)
    rdr         running (io: 19438)
    srv         running (io: 19438)
    pvfs        running (io: 19438)
    npfs        running (io: 19438)
    netlogon    running (standalone: 19468)
    srvsvc      running (standalone: 19529)

    $ lwsm info lsass
    Service: lsass
