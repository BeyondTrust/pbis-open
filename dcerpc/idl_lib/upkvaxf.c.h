**  Functional Description:
**
**  This module contains code to extract information from a VAX
**  f_floating number and to initialize an UNPACKED_REAL structure
**  with those bits.
**
**  See the header files for a description of the UNPACKED_REAL
**  structure.
**
**  A VAX f_floating number in (16 bit words) looks like:
**
**      [0]: Sign bit, 8 exp bits (bias 128), 7 fraction bits
**      [1]: 16 more fraction bits
**
**      0.5 <= fraction < 1.0, MSB implicit
**
**
**  Implicit parameters:
**
**  	input_value: a pointer to the input parameter.
**
**  	r: an UNPACKED_REAL structure
**
