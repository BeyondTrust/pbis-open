Demo Applet:	Echo Server
===========================


This RPC application implements a simple single-function RPC server
interface. The function ReverseIt() accepts as input an array of
strings. It reverses the order of characters in the strings, and
returns the results to the client.

Build Instructions
------------------

	- echo_client and echo_server build by default with the
	  Linux build.

	- The Makefile can be edited to compile the demo app on
	  Solaris with Transarc DCE and AIX with IBM's DCE product.
	  Edit the makefile and run make.


Running the Application
-----------------------

	1.  The RPC endpoint mapper daemon needs to be running on
	    the machine where the Echo server runs. If you are
	    running vendor DCE, this already handled for you by the
	    'dced' process. On Linux, you can start rpcd if it is not
	    already running. As root:

		#  /etc/rc.d/init.d/ rc.dcerpcd start


	2.  Start the echo_server, you do not need to be root to
	    do this:

		./echo_server


	3. The Echo client can be run on any machine on the internet,
	   or it can simply be run on the same host as that the
	   echo server runs on.  

	   Run the echo_client, telling it the host where to look
	   for the echo server. i.e.:

		./echo_client -h acs4.bu.edu

	   Additionally, you can tell it to specifically use the
	   TCP registration -or- the UDP registration that the
	   server is listening on.

		./echo_client -h acs4.bu.edu -u     <= call using UDP RPC
		./echo_client -h acs4.bu.edu -t	    <= call using TCP RPC


	4. You can feed the echo client large gobs of text from
	   a flatfile as well as from the prompt.  Here's how you can
	   see what a Unix man page looks like printed in reverse. :)

		$ man gcc > /tmp/blah
		$ ./echo_client -h localhost < /tmp/blah
