1.1 Why Should I use Kerberos?
==============================

Since Kerberos negotiates authenticated, and optionally encrypted,
communications between two points anywhere on the internet, it provides
a layer of security that is not dependent on which side of a firewall
either client is on.  Since studies have shown that half of the computer

2 How Kerberos Works
********************

This section provides a simplified description of a general user's
interaction with the Kerberos system.  This interaction happens
transparently--users don't need to know and probably don't care about
what's going on--but Kerberos administrators might find a schematic
description of the process useful.  This description glosses over a lot
of details; for more information, see Kerberos: An Authentication
Service for Open Network Systems, a paper presented at Winter USENIX
1988, in Dallas, Texas.  This paper can be retreived by FTP from
`athena-dist.mit.edu', in the location:

2.1 Network Services and Their Client Programs
==============================================

In an environment that provides network services, you use "client"
programs to request "services" from "server" programs that are
somewhere on the network.  Suppose you have logged in to a workstation
and you want to `rlogin' to a typical UNIX host.  You use the local
`rlogin' client program to contact the remote machine's `rlogind'
daemon.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Kerberos Tickets,  Next: The Kerberos Database,  Prev: Network Services and Their Client Programs,  Up: How Kerberos Works

2.2 Kerberos Tickets
====================

Under Kerberos, the `klogind' daemon allows you to login to a remote
machine if you can provide `klogind' a Kerberos ticket which proves
your identity.  In addition to the ticket, you must also have
possession of the corresponding ticket session key. The combination of
a ticket and the ticket's session key is known as a credential.

Typically, a client program automatically obtains credentials
identifying the person using the client program.  The credentials are
obtained from a Kerberos server that resides somewhere on the network.
A Kerberos server maintains a database of user, server, and password
information.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: The Kerberos Database,  Next: Kerberos Realms,  Prev: Kerberos Tickets,  Up: How Kerberos Works

2.3 The Kerberos Database
=========================

Kerberos will give you credentials only if you have an entry in the
Kerberos server's "Kerberos database".  Your database entry includes
your Kerberos "principal" (an identifying string, which is often just
your username), and your Kerberos password.  Every Kerberos user must
have an entry in this database.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Kerberos Realms,  Next: The Ticket-Granting Ticket,  Prev: The Kerberos Database,  Up: How Kerberos Works

2.4 Kerberos Realms
===================

Each administrative domain will have its own Kerberos database, which
contains information about the users and services for that particular
site or administrative domain.  This administrative domain is the
"Kerberos realm".

Each Kerberos realm will have at least one Kerberos server, where the
master Kerberos database for that site or administrative domain is
stored.  A Kerberos realm may also have one or more "slave servers",
which have read-only copies of the Kerberos database that are
periodically propagated from the master server.  For more details on how
this is done, see the "Set Up the Slave KDCs for Database Propagation"
and "Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC" sections of the Kerberos
V5 Installation Guide.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: The Ticket-Granting Ticket,  Next: Network Services and the Master Database,  Prev: Kerberos Realms,  Up: How Kerberos Works

2.5 The Ticket-Granting Ticket
==============================

The `kinit' command prompts for your password.  If you enter it
successfully, you will obtain a "ticket-granting ticket" and a "ticket
session key" which gives you the right to use the ticket.  This
combination of the ticket and its associated key is known as your
"credentials".  As illustrated below, client programs use your
ticket-granting ticket credentials in order to obtain client-specific
credentials as needed.

Your credentials are stored in a "credentials cache", which is often
just a file in `/tmp'.  The credentials cache is also called the
"ticket file", especially in Kerberos V4 documentation.  Note, however,
that a credentials cache does not have to be stored in a file.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Network Services and the Master Database,  Next: The User/Kerberos Interaction,  Prev: The Ticket-Granting Ticket,  Up: How Kerberos Works

2.6 Network Services and the Master Database
============================================

The master database also contains entries for all network services that
require Kerberos authentication.  Suppose that your site has a machine,
`laughter.mit.edu', that requires Kerberos authentication from anyone
who wants to `rlogin' to it.  The host's Kerberos realm is
`ATHENA.MIT.EDU'.

This service must be registered in the Kerberos database, using the
proper service name, which in this case is the "principal":

     host/laughter.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

The `/' character separates the Kerberos "primary" (in this case,
`host') from the "instance" (in this case, `laughter.mit.edu'); the `@'
character separates the realm name (in this case, `ATHENA.MIT.EDU')
from the rest of the principal.  The primary, `host', denotes the name
or type of the service that is being offered:  generic host-level
access to the machine.  The instance, `laughter.mit.edu', names the
specific machine that is offering this service.  There will generally be
many different machines, each offering one particular type of service,
and the instance serves to give each one of these servers a different
Kerberos principal.

* Menu:

* The Keytab File::


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: The Keytab File,  Prev: Network Services and the Master Database,  Up: Network Services and the Master Database

2.6.1 The Keytab File
---------------------

For each service, there must also be a "service key" known only by
Kerberos and the service.  On the Kerberos server, the service key is
stored in the Kerberos database.

On the server host, these service keys are stored in "key tables",
which are files known as "keytabs".(1)  For example, the service keys
used by services that run as root are usually stored in the keytab file
`/etc/krb5.keytab'.  N.B.: This service key is the equivalent of the
service's password, and must be kept secure.  Data which is meant to be
read only by the service is encrypted using this key.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Keytabs were called "srvtabs" in Kerberos V4.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: The User/Kerberos Interaction,  Next: Definitions,  Prev: Network Services and the Master Database,  Up: How Kerberos Works

2.7 The User/Kerberos Interaction
=================================

Suppose that you walk up to a host intending to login to it, and then
`rlogin' to the machine `laughter'.  Here's what happens:

  1. You login to the workstation and use the `kinit' command to get a
     ticket-granting ticket.  This command prompts you for your Kerberos
     password.  (On systems running the Kerberos V5 `login' program,
     this may be done as part of the login process, not requiring the
     user to run a separate program.)

       A. The `kinit' command sends your request to the Kerberos master
          server machine.  The server software looks for your principal
          name's entry in the Kerberos database.

       B. If this entry exists, the Kerberos server creates and returns
          a ticket-granting ticket and the key which allows you to use
          it, encrypted by your password.  If `kinit' can decrypt the
          Kerberos reply using the password you provide, it stores this
          ticket in a credentials cache on your local machine for later
          use.  The name of the credentials cache can be specified in
          the `KRB5CCNAME' environment variable.  If this variable is
          not set, the name of the file will be `/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>',
          where <uid> is your UNIX user-id, represented in decimal
          format.

  2. Now you use the `rlogin' client to access the machine `laughter'.

          host% rlogin laughter

       A. The `rlogin' client checks your ticket file to see if you
          have a ticket for the `host' service for `laughter'.  You
          don't, so `rlogin' uses the credential cache's
          ticket-granting ticket to make a request to the master
          server's ticket-granting service.

       B. This ticket-granting service receives the request for a
          ticket for `host/laughter.mit.edu', and looks in the master
          database for an entry for `host/laughter.mit.edu'.  If the
          entry exists, the ticket-granting service issues you a ticket
          for that service.  That ticket is also cached in your
          credentials cache.

       C. The `rlogin' client now sends that ticket to the `laughter'
          `klogind' service program.  The service program checks the
          ticket by using its own service key.  If the ticket is valid,
          it now knows your identity.  If you are allowed to login to
          `laughter' (because your username matches one in /etc/passwd,
          or your Kerberos principal is in the appropriate `.k5login'
          file), `klogind' will let you login.

2.8 Definitions
===============

Following are definitions of some of the Kerberos terminology.

client
     an entity that can obtain a ticket.  This entity is usually either
     a user or a host.

host
     a computer that can be accessed over a network.

Kerberos
     in Greek mythology, the three-headed dog that guards the entrance
     to the underworld.  In the computing world, Kerberos is a network
     security package that was developed at MIT.

KDC
     Key Distribution Center.  A machine that issues Kerberos tickets.

keytab
     a key table file containing one or more keys.  A host or service
     uses a "keytab" file in much the same way as a user uses his/her
     password.

principal
     a string that names a specific entity to which a set of
     credentials may be assigned.  It can have an arbitrary number of
     components, but generally has three:

    primary
          the first part of a Kerberos principal.  In the case of a
          user, it is the username.  In the case of a service, it is
          the name of the service.

    instance
          the second part of a Kerberos principal.  It gives
          information that qualifies the primary.  The instance may be
          null.  In the case of a user, the instance is often used to
          describe the intended use of the corresponding credentials.
          In the case of a host, the instance is the fully qualified
          hostname.

    realm
          the logical network served by a single Kerberos database and
          a set of Key Distribution Centers.  By convention, realm
          names are generally all uppercase letters, to differentiate
          the realm from the internet domain.

     The typical format of a typical Kerberos principal is
     primary/instance@REALM.

service
     any program or computer you access over a network.  Examples of
     services include "host" (a host, e.g., when you use `telnet' and
     `rsh'), "ftp" (FTP), "krbtgt" (authentication; cf. ticket-granting
     ticket), and "pop" (email).

ticket
     a temporary set of electronic credentials that verify the identity
     of a client for a particular service.

TGT
     Ticket-Granting Ticket.  A special Kerberos ticket that permits the
     client to obtain additional Kerberos tickets within the same
     Kerberos realm.

File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Supported Encryption Types,  Next: Salts,  Prev: Configuration Files,  Up: Configuration Files

3.1 Supported Encryption Types
==============================

Any tag in the configuration files which requires a list of encryption
types can be set to some combination of the following strings.
Encryption types marked as "weak" are available for compatibility but
not recommended for use.

`des-cbc-crc'
     DES cbc mode with CRC-32 (weak)

`des-cbc-md4'
     DES cbc mode with RSA-MD4 (weak)

`des-cbc-md5'
     DES cbc mode with RSA-MD5 (weak)

`des-cbc-raw'
     DES cbc mode raw (weak)

`des3-cbc-raw'
     Triple DES cbc mode raw (weak)

`des3-cbc-sha1'
`des3-hmac-sha1'
`des3-cbc-sha1-kd'
     Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1

`des-hmac-sha1'
     DES with HMAC/sha1 (weak)

`aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96'
`aes256-cts'
     AES-256 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC

`aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96'
`aes128-cts'
     AES-128 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC

`arcfour-hmac'
`rc4-hmac'
`arcfour-hmac-md5'
     RC4 with HMAC/MD5

`arcfour-hmac-exp'
`rc4-hmac-exp'
`arcfour-hmac-md5-exp'
     Exportable RC4 with HMAC/MD5 (weak)

While aes128-cts and aes256-cts are supported for all Kerberos
operations, they are not supported by older versions of our GSSAPI
implementation (krb5-1.3.1 and earlier).

By default, AES is enabled in this release.  Sites wishing to use AES
encryption types on their KDCs need to be careful not to give GSSAPI
services AES keys if the servers have not been updated.  If older
GSSAPI services are given AES keys, then services may fail when clients
supporting AES for GSSAPI are used.  Sites may wish to use AES for user
keys and for the ticket granting ticket key, although doing so requires
specifying what encryption types are used as each principal is created.

If all GSSAPI-based services have been updated before or with the KDC,
this is not an issue.

3.2 Salts
=========

Your Kerberos key is derived from your password.  To ensure that people
who happen to pick the same password do not have the same key, Kerberos
5 incorporates more information into the key using something called a
salt.  The supported values for salts are as follows.

`normal'
     default for Kerberos Version 5

`v4'
     the only type used by Kerberos Version 4, no salt

`norealm'
     same as the default, without using realm information

`onlyrealm'
     uses only realm information as the salt

`afs3'
     AFS version 3, only used for compatibility with Kerberos 4 in AFS

`special'
     only used in very special cases; not fully supported


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: krb5.conf,  Next: kdc.conf,  Prev: Salts,  Up: Configuration Files

3.3 krb5.conf
=============

The `krb5.conf' file contains Kerberos configuration information,
including the locations of KDCs and admin servers for the Kerberos
realms of interest, defaults for the current realm and for Kerberos
applications, and mappings of hostnames onto Kerberos realms.  Normally,
you should install your `krb5.conf' file in the directory `/etc'.  You
can override the default location by setting the environment variable
`KRB5_CONFIG'.

The `krb5.conf' file is set up in the style of a Windows INI file.
Sections are headed by the section name, in square brackets.  Each
section may contain zero or more relations, of the form:

     foo = bar

or

     fubar = {
             foo = bar
             baz = quux
     }

Placing a `*' at the end of a line indicates that this is the "final"
value for the tag.  This means that neither the remainder of this
configuration file nor any other configuration file will be checked for
any other values for this tag.

For example, if you have the following lines:

     foo = bar*
     foo = baz

then the second value of foo (baz) would never be read.

The `krb5.conf' file may contain any or all of the following sections:

libdefaults
     Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 library.

login
     Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 login program.

appdefaults
     Contains default values that can be used by Kerberos V5
     applications.

realms
     Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm names.  Each
     subsection describes realm-specific information, including where
     to find the Kerberos servers for that realm.

domain_realm
     Contains relations which map domain names and subdomains onto
     Kerberos realm names.  This is used by programs to determine what
     realm a host should be in, given its fully qualified domain name.

logging
     Contains relations which determine how Kerberos programs are to
     perform logging.

capaths
     Contains the authentication paths used with direct
     (nonhierarchical) cross-realm authentication.  Entries in this
     section are used by the client to determine the intermediate
     realms which may be used in cross-realm authentication.  It is
     also used by the end-service when checking the transited field for
     trusted intermediate realms.

3.3.1 [libdefaults]
-------------------

The `libdefaults' section may contain any of the following relations:

default_keytab_name
     This relation specifies the default keytab name to be used by
     application servers such as telnetd and rlogind.  The default is
     /etc/krb5.keytab.

default_realm
     Identifies the default Kerberos realm for the client.  Set its
     value to your Kerberos realm.  If this is not specified and the
     TXT record lookup is enabled (see *Note Using DNS::), then that
     information will be used to determine the default realm.  If this
     tag is not set in this configuration file and there is no DNS
     information found, then an error will be returned.

default_tgs_enctypes
     Identifies the supported list of session key encryption types that
     should be returned by the KDC.  The list may be delimited with
     commas or whitespace.  Kerberos supports many different encryption
     types, and support for more is planned in the future. (see *Note
     Supported Encryption Types:: for a list of the accepted values for
     this tag).  The default value is aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96
     aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1 arcfour-hmac-md5 des-cbc-crc
     des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-md4.

default_tkt_enctypes
     Identifies the supported list of session key encryption types that
     should be requested by the client.  The format is the same as for
     _default_tgs_enctypes_.  The default value for this tag is
     aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1
     arcfour-hmac-md5 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-md4.

permitted_enctypes
     Identifies all encryption types that are permitted for use in
     session key encryption.  The default value for this tag is
     aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1
     arcfour-hmac-md5 des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-md4.

allow_weak_crypto
     If this is set to 0 (for false), then weak encryption types will be
     filtered out of the previous three lists (as noted in *Note
     Supported Encryption Types::).  The default value for this tag is
     true, but that default may change in the future.

clockskew
     Sets the maximum allowable amount of clockskew in seconds that the
     library  will tolerate before assuming that a Kerberos message is
     invalid.  The default value is 300 seconds, or five minutes.

kdc_timesync
     If this is set to 1 (for true), then client machines will compute
     the difference between their time and the time returned by the KDC
     in the timestamps in the tickets and use this value to correct for
     an inaccurate system clock.  This corrective factor is only used
     by the Kerberos library.  The default is 1.

kdc_req_checksum_type
ap_req_checksum_type
safe_checksum_type
     An integer which specifies the type of checksum to use.  Used for
     compatability with DCE security servers which do not support the
     default RSA MD5 used by this version of Kerberos.  The
     kdc_req_checksum_type is only used for DES keys.   The
     ap_req_checksum_type defaults to the preferred checksum for the
     encryption type being used if unset.  If set, then the selected
     checksum is used regardless of the type of key being used.  The
     possible values and their meanings are as follows.

    1
          CRC32

    2
          RSA MD4

    3
          RSA MD4 DES

    4
          DES CBC

    7
          RSA MD5

    8
          RSA MD5 DES

    9
          NIST SHA

    12
          HMAC SHA1 DES3

    -138
          Microsoft MD5 HMAC checksum type

ccache_type
     Use this parameter on systems which are DCE clients, to specify the
     type of cache to be created by kinit, or when forwarded tickets are
     received.  DCE and Kerberos can share the cache, but some versions
     of DCE do not support the default cache as created by this version
     of Kerberos.  Use a value of 1 on DCE 1.0.3a systems, and a value
     of 2 on DCE 1.1 systems.  The default value is 4.

dns_lookup_kdc
     Indicate whether DNS SRV records should be used to locate the KDCs
     and other servers for a realm, if they are not listed in the
     information for the realm.  (Note that the `admin_server' entry
     must be in the file, because the DNS implementation for it is
     incomplete.)

     Enabling this option does open up a type of denial-of-service
     attack, if someone spoofs the DNS records and redirects you to
     another server.  However, it's no worse than a denial of service,
     because that fake KDC will be unable to decode anything you send
     it (besides the initial ticket request, which has no encrypted
     data), and anything the fake KDC sends will not be trusted without
     verification using some secret that it won't know.

     If this option is not specified but `dns_fallback' is, that value
     will be used instead.  If neither option is specified, the behavior
     depends on configure-time options; if none were given, the default
     is to enable this option.  If the DNS support is not compiled in,
     this entry has no effect.

dns_lookup_realm
     Indicate whether DNS TXT records should be used to determine the
     Kerberos realm of a host.

     Enabling this option may permit a redirection attack, where
     spoofed DNS replies persuade a client to authenticate to the wrong
     realm, when talking to the wrong host (either by spoofing yet more
     DNS records or by intercepting the net traffic).  Depending on how
     the client software manages hostnames, however, it could already
     be vulnerable to such attacks.  We are looking at possible ways to
     minimize or eliminate this exposure.  For now, we encourage more
     adventurous sites to try using Secure DNS.

     If this option is not specified but `dns_fallback' is, that value
     will be used instead.  If neither option is specified, the behavior
     depends on configure-time options; if none were given, the default
     is to disable this option.  If the DNS support is not compiled in,
     this entry has no effect.

dns_fallback
     General flag controlling the use of DNS for Kerberos information.
     If both of the preceding options are specified, this option has no
     effect.

extra_addresses
     This allows a computer to use multiple local addresses, in order to
     allow Kerberos to work in a network that uses NATs.  The addresses
     should be in a comma-separated list.

udp_preference_limit
     When sending a message to the KDC, the library will try using TCP
     before UDP if the size of the message is above
     `udp_preference_list'.  If the message is smaller than
     `udp_preference_list', then UDP will be tried before TCP.
     Regardless of the size, both protocols will be tried if the first
     attempt fails.

verify_ap_req_nofail
     If this flag is set, then an attempt to get initial credentials
     will fail if the client machine does not have a keytab.  The
     default for the flag is not set.

renew_lifetime
     The value of this tag is the default renewable lifetime for
     initial tickets.  The default value for the tag is
     0.

noaddresses
     Setting this flag causes the initial Kerberos ticket to be
     addressless.  The default for the flag is set.

forwardable
     If this flag is set, initial tickets by default will be
     forwardable.  The default value for this flag is not set.

proxiable
     If this flag is set, initial tickets by default will be proxiable.
     The default value for this flag is not set.

3.3.2 [appdefaults]
-------------------

Each tag in the [appdefaults] section names a Kerberos V5 application
or an option that is used by some Kerberos V5 application[s].  The
value of the tag defines the default behaviors for that application.

For example:

     [appdefaults]
         telnet = {
             ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
                  option1 = false
             }
         }
         telnet = {
             option1 = true
             option2 = true
         }
         ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
             option2 = false
         }
         option2 = true

The above four ways of specifying the value of an option are shown in
order of decreasing precedence.   In this example, if telnet is running
in the realm EXAMPLE.COM, it should, by default, have option1 and
option2 set to true.  However, a telnet program in the realm
ATHENA.MIT.EDU should have option1 set to false and option2 set to
true.  Any other programs in ATHENA.MIT.EDU should have option2 set to
false by default.  Any programs running in other realms should have
option2 set to true.

The list of specifiable options for each application may be found in
that application's man pages.  The application defaults specified here
are overridden by those specified in the [realms] section.

Each tag in the [login] section of the file is an option for
login.krb5.  This section may contain any of the following relations:

krb5_get_tickets
     Indicate whether or not to use a user's password to get V5 tickets.
     The default value is true.

krb_run_aklog
     Indicate whether or not to run aklog.  The default value is
     false.

aklog_path
     Indicate where to find aklog.  The default value is
     $(prefix)/bin/aklog.

accept_passwd
     A true value will cause login not to accept plaintext passwords.
     The default value is false.  This is not yet implemented.

3.3.4 [realms]
--------------

Each tag in the [realms] section of the file is the name of a Kerberos
realm.  The value of the tag is a subsection with relations that define
the properties of that particular realm.  For each realm, the following
tags may be specified in the realm's subsection:

kdc
     The name of a host running a KDC for that realm.  An optional port
     number (separated from the hostname by a colon) may be included.
     For your computer to be able to communicate with the KDC for each
     realm, this tag must be given a value in each realm subsection in
     the configuration file, or there must be DNS SRV records
     specifying the KDCs (see *Note Using DNS::).

master_kdc
     Identifies the master KDC(s).  Currently, this tag is used in only
     one case: If an attempt to get credentials fails because of an
     invalid password, the client software will attempt to contact the
     master KDC, in case the user's password has just been changed, and
     the updated database has not been propagated to the slave servers
     yet.  (We don't currently check whether the KDC from which the
     initial response came is on the master KDC list.  That may be
     fixed in the future.)

database_module
     This relation indicates the name of the configuration section
     under [dbmodules] for database specific parameters used by the
     loadable database library.

admin_server
     Identifies the host where the administration server is running.
     Typically, this is the master Kerberos server.  This tag must be
     given a value in order to communicate with the kadmin server for
     the realm.

default_domain
     This tag is used for Kerberos 4 compatibility.  Kerberos 4 does not
     require the entire hostname of a server to be in its principal like
     Kerberos 5 does.  This tag provides the domain name needed to
     produce a full hostname when translating V4 principal names into
     V5 principal names.  All servers in this realm are assumed to be
     in the domain given as the value of this tag

v4_instance_convert
     This subsection allows the administrator to configure exceptions
     to the default_domain mapping rule.  It contains V4 instances (the
     tag name) which should be translated to some specific hostname
     (the tag value) as the second component in a Kerberos V5 principal
     name.

v4_realm
     This relation is used by the krb524 library routines when
     converting a V5 principal name to a V4 principal name.  It is used
     when the V4 realm name and the V5 realm name are not the same, but
     still share the same principal names and passwords.  The tag value
     is the Kerberos V4 realm name.

auth_to_local_names
     This subsection allows you to set explicit mappings from principal
     names to local user names.  The tag is the mapping name, and the
     value is the corresponding local user name.

auth_to_local
     This tag allows you to set a general rule for mapping principal
     names to local user names.  It will be used if there is not an
     explicit mapping for the principal name that is being translated.
     The possible values are:

    DB:filename
          The principal will be looked up in the database filename.
          Support for this is not currently compiled in by default.

    RULE:exp
          The local name will be formulated from exp.

          The format for exp is
          `[n:$d..string](regexp)s/pattern/replacement/g'.  The integer
          n indicates how many components the target principal should
          have.  If this matches, then a string will be formed by
          putting together the components of the principal in the order
          indicated by each integer d, and the arbitrary string string
          (i.e. if the principal was johndoe/admin then [2:$2$1foo]
          would result in the string "adminjohndoefoo".  If this string
          matches regexp, then the `s//[g]' substitution command will
          be run over the string.  The optional g will cause the
          substitution to be global over the string, instead of
          replacing only the first match in the string.

    DEFAULT
          The principal name will be used as the local user name.  If
          the principal has more than one component or is not in the
          default realm, this rule is not applicable and the conversion
          will fail.


     For example:

          [realms]
              ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
                  auth_to_local = {
                      RULE:[2:$1](johndoe)s/^.*$/guest/
                      RULE:[2:$1;$2](^.*;admin$)s/;admin$//
                      RULE:[2:$2](^.*;root)s/^.*$/root/
                      DEFAULT
                      }
                  }

     would result in any principal without `root' or `admin' as the
     second component to be translated with the default rule.  A
     principal with a second component of `admin' will become its first
     component.  `root' will be used as the local name for any
     principal with a second component of `root'.  The exception to
     these two rules are any principals johndoe/*, which will always
     get the local name `guest'.

3.3.5 [domain_realm]
--------------------

The [domain_realm] section provides a translation from a domain name or
hostname to a Kerberos realm name.  The tag name can be a host name, or
a domain name, where domain names are indicated by a prefix of a period
(`.').  The value of the relation is the Kerberos realm name for that
particular host or domain.  Host names and domain names should be in
lower case.

If no translation entry applies, the host's realm is considered to be
the hostname's domain portion converted to upper case.  For example, the
following [domain_realm] section:

     [domain_realm]
         .mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
         mit.edu = ATHENA.MIT.EDU
         crash.mit.edu = TEST.ATHENA.MIT.EDU
         example.com = EXAMPLE.COM

maps crash.mit.edu into the TEST.ATHENA.MIT.EDU realm.  All other hosts
in the mit.edu domain will map by default to the ATHENA.MIT.EDU realm,
and all hosts in the example.com domain will map by default into the
EXAMPLE.COM realm.  Note the entries for the hosts mit.edu and
example.com.  Without these entries, these hosts would be mapped into
the Kerberos realms `EDU' and `ORG', respectively.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: logging,  Next: capaths,  Prev: domain_realm,  Up: krb5.conf

3.3.6 [logging]
---------------

The [logging] section indicates how a particular entity is to perform
its logging.  The relations in this section assign one or more values to
the entity name.  Currently, the following entities are used:

kdc
     These entries specify how the KDC is to perform its logging.

admin_server
     These entries specify how the administrative server is to perform
     its logging.

default
     These entries specify how to perform logging in the absence of
     explicit specifications otherwise.

Values are of the following forms:

FILE=<filename>
FILE:<filename>
     This value causes the entity's logging messages to go to the
     specified file.  If the `=' form is used, the file is overwritten.
     If the `:' form is used, the file is appended to.

STDERR
     This value causes the entity's logging messages to go to its
     standard error stream.

CONSOLE
     This value causes the entity's logging messages to go to the
     console, if the system supports it.

DEVICE=<devicename>
     This causes the entity's logging messages to go to the specified
     device.

SYSLOG[:<severity>[:<facility>]]
     This causes the entity's logging messages to go to the system log.

     The "severity" argument specifies the default severity of system
     log messages.  This may be any of the following severities
     supported by the `syslog(3)' call, minus the LOG_ prefix:
     LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR, LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE,
     LOG_INFO, and LOG_DEBUG.  For example, a value of `CRIT' would
     specify LOG_CRIT severity.

     The facility argument specifies the facility under which the
     messages are logged.  This may be any of the following facilities
     supported by the syslog(3) call minus the LOG_ prefix:  LOG_KERN,
     LOG_USER, LOG_MAIL, LOG_DAEMON, LOG_AUTH, LOG_LPR, LOG_NEWS,
     LOG_UUCP, LOG_CRON, and LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7.

     If no severity is specified, the default is ERR.  If no facility is
     specified, the default is AUTH.

In the following example, the logging messages from the KDC will go to
the console and to the system log under the facility LOG_DAEMON with
default severity of LOG_INFO; and the logging messages from the
administrative server will be appended to the file /var/adm/kadmin.log
and sent to the device /dev/tty04.

     [logging]
         kdc = CONSOLE
         kdc = SYSLOG:INFO:DAEMON
         admin_server = FILE:/var/adm/kadmin.log
         admin_server = DEVICE=/dev/tty04

3.3.7 [capaths]
---------------

In order to perform direct (non-hierarchical) cross-realm
authentication, a database is needed to construct the authentication
paths between the realms.  This section defines that database.

A client will use this section to find the authentication path between
its realm and the realm of the server.  The server will use this section
to verify the authentication path used by the client, by checking the
transited field of the received ticket.

There is a tag for each participating realm, and each tag has subtags
for each of the realms.  The value of the subtags is an intermediate
realm which may participate in the cross-realm authentication.  The
subtags may be repeated if there is more then one intermediate realm.  A
value of "."  means that the two realms share keys directly, and no
intermediate realms should be allowed to participate.

There are n**2 possible entries in this table, but only those entries
which will be needed on the client or the server need to be present.
The client needs a tag for its local realm, with subtags for all the
realms of servers it will need to authenticate with.  A server needs a
tag for each realm of the clients it will serve.

For example, ANL.GOV, PNL.GOV, and NERSC.GOV all wish to use the ES.NET
realm as an intermediate realm.  ANL has a sub realm of TEST.ANL.GOV
which will authenticate with NERSC.GOV but not PNL.GOV.  The [capaths]
section for ANL.GOV systems would look like this:

     [capaths]
         ANL.GOV = {
             TEST.ANL.GOV = .
             PNL.GOV = ES.NET
             NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
             ES.NET = .
         }
         TEST.ANL.GOV = {
             ANL.GOV = .
         }
         PNL.GOV = {
             ANL.GOV = ES.NET
         }
         NERSC.GOV = {
             ANL.GOV = ES.NET
         }
         ES.NET = {
             ANL.GOV = .
         }

The [capaths] section of the configuration file used on NERSC.GOV
systems would look like this:

     [capaths]
         NERSC.GOV = {
             ANL.GOV = ES.NET
             TEST.ANL.GOV = ES.NET
             TEST.ANL.GOV = ANL.GOV
             PNL.GOV = ES.NET
             ES.NET = .
         }
         ANL.GOV = {
             NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
         }
         PNL.GOV = {
             NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
         }
         ES.NET = {
             NERSC.GOV = .
         }
         TEST.ANL.GOV = {
             NERSC.GOV = ANL.GOV
             NERSC.GOV = ES.NET
         }

In the above examples, the ordering is not important, except when the
same subtag name is used more then once.  The client will use this to
determine the path.  (It is not important to the server, since the
transited field is not sorted.)

This feature is not currently supported by DCE.  DCE security servers
can be used with Kerberized clients and servers, but versions prior to
DCE 1.1 did not fill in the transited field, and should be used with
caution.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: dbdefaults,  Next: dbmodules,  Prev: capaths,  Up: krb5.conf

3.3.8 [dbdefaults]
------------------

The [dbdefaults] section provides default values for the database
specific parameters. It can also specify the configuration section
under [dbmodules] section for database specific parameters used by the
database library.(*note dbmodules::).

The following tags are used in this section:

database_module
     This relation indicates the name of the configuration section
     under the [dbmodules] for database specific parameters used by the
     loadable database library.

ldap_kerberos_container_dn
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the DN of the container object
     where the realm objects will be located. This value is used if the
     container object is not mentioned in the configuration section
     under [dbmodules].

ldap_kdc_dn
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the default bind DN for the KDC
     server. The KDC server does a login to the directory as this
     object. This object should have the rights to read the Kerberos
     data in the LDAP database. This value is used if the bind DN for
     the KDC is not mentioned in the configuration section under
     [dbmodules].

ldap_kadmind_dn
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the default bind DN for the
     Administration server. The administration server does a login to
     the directory as this object. This object should have the rights
     to read and write the Kerberos data in the LDAP database. This
     value is used if the bind DN for the Administration server is not
     mentioned in the configuration section under [dbmodules].

ldap_service_password_file
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the file containing the stashed
     passwords (created by `kdb5_ldap_util stashsrvpw') for the objects
     used by the Kerberos servers to bind to the LDAP server. This file
     must be kept secure. This value is used if no service password
     file is mentioned in the configuration section under [dbmodules].

ldap_server
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the list of LDAP servers that the
     Kerberos servers can connect to. The list of LDAP servers is
     whitespace-separated. The LDAP server is specified by a LDAP URI.
     This value is used if no LDAP servers are mentioned in the
     configuration section under [dbmodules]. It is recommended to use
     the ldapi:// or ldaps:// interface and not to use ldap://
     interface.

ldap_conns_per_server
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the number of connections to be
     maintained per LDAP server. This value is used if the number of
     connections per LDAP server are not mentioned in the configuration
     section under [dbmodules]. The default value is 5.

3.3.9 [dbmodules]
-----------------

Contains database specific parameters used by the database library.
Each tag in the [dbmodules] section of the file names a configuration
section for database specific parameters that can be referred to by a
realm. The value of the tag is a subsection where the relations in that
subsection define the database specific parameters.

For each section, the following tags may be specified in the subsection:

db_library
     This tag indicates the name of the loadable database library. The
     value should be `db2' for DB2 database and `kldap' for LDAP
     database.

ldap_kerberos_container_dn
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the DN of the container object
     where the realm objects will be located.

ldap_kdc_dn
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the default bind DN for the KDC
     server. The KDC server does a login to the directory as this
     object. This object should have the rights to read the Kerberos
     data in the LDAP database.

ldap_kadmind_dn
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the default bind DN for the
     Administration server. The administration server does a login to
     the directory as this object. This object should have the rights
     to read and write the Kerberos data in the LDAP database.

ldap_service_password_file
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the file containing the stashed
     passwords (created by `kdb5_ldap_util stashsrvpw') for the objects
     used by the Kerberos servers to bind to the LDAP server. This file
     must be kept secure.

ldap_server
     This LDAP specific tag indicates the list of LDAP servers that the
     Kerberos servers can connect to. The list of LDAP servers is
     whitespace-separated. The LDAP server is specified by a LDAP URI.
     It is recommended to use ldapi:// or ldaps:// interface to connect
     to the LDAP server.

ldap_conns_per_server
     This LDAP specific tags indicates the number of connections to be
     maintained per LDAP server.

3.3.10.1 Specifying pkinit identity information
...............................................

The syntax for specifying Public Key identity, trust, and revocation
information for pkinit is as follows:
FILE:file-name[,key-file-name]
     This option has context-specific behavior.
    pkinit_identity
    pkinit_identities
          file-name specifies the name of a PEM-format file containing
          the user's certificate.  If key-file-name is not specified,
          the user's private key is expected to be in file-name as
          well.  Otherwise, key-file-name is the name of the file
          containing the private key.

    pkinit_anchors
    pkinit_pool
          file-name is assumed to be the name of an OpenSSL-style
          ca-bundle file.

DIR:directory-name
     This option has context-specific behavior.
    pkinit_identity
    pkinit_identities
          directory-name specifies a directory with files named `*.crt'
          and `*.key', where the first part of the file name is the
          same for matching pairs of certificate and private key files.
          When a file with a name ending with `.crt' is found, a
          matching file ending with `.key' is assumed to contain the
          private key.  If no such file is found, then the certificate
          in the `.crt' is not used.

    pkinit_anchors
    pkinit_pool
          directory-name is assumed to be an OpenSSL-style hashed CA
          directory where each CA cert is stored in a file named
          hash-of-ca-cert.#.  This infrastructure is encouraged, but
          all files in the directory will be examined and if they
          contain certificates (in PEM format), they will be used.

    pkinit_revoke
          directory-name is assumed to be an OpenSSL-style hashed CA
          directory where each revocation list is stored in a file
          named hash-of-ca-cert.r#.  This infrastructure is encouraged,
          but all files in the directory will be examined and if they
          contain a revocation list (in PEM format), they will be used.

PKCS12:pkcs12-file-name
     pkcs12-file-name is the name of a `PKCS #12' format file,
     containing the user's certificate and private key.

PKCS11:[module_name=]module-name[:slotid=slot-id][:token=token-label][:certid=cert-id][:certlabel=cert-label]
     All keyword/values are optional.  module-name specifies the
     location of a library implementing `PKCS #11'.  If a value is
     encountered with not keyword, it is assumed to be the module-name.
     If no module-name is specified, the default is `opensc-pkcs11.so'.
     slotid= and/or token= may be specified to force the use of a
     particular smard card reader or token if there is more than one
     available.  certid= and/or certlabel= may be specified to force
     the selection of a particular certificate on the device.  See the
     `pkinit_cert_match' configuration option for more ways to select a
     particular certificate to use for pkinit.

ENV:environment-variable-name
     environment-variable-name specifies the name of an environment
     variable which has been set to a value conforming to one of the
     previous values.  For example, `ENV:X509_PROXY', where environment
     variable `X509_PROXY' has been set to `FILE:/tmp/my_proxy.pem'.

3.3.10.2 pkinit krb5.conf options
.................................

pkinit_identities
     Specifies the location(s) to be used to find the user's X.509
     identity information.  This option may be specified multiple times.
     Each value is attempted in order until identity information is
     found and authentication is attempted.  Note that these values are
     not used if the user specifies X509_user_identity on the command
     line.

pkinit_anchors
     Specifies the location of trusted anchor (root) certificates which
     the client trusts to sign KDC certificates.  This option may be
     specified multiple times.  These values from the config file are
     not used if the user specifies X509_anchors on the command line.

pkinit_pool
     Specifies the location of intermediate certificates which may be
     used by the client to complete the trust chain between a KDC
     certificate and a trusted anchor.  This option may be specified
     multiple times.

pkinit_revoke
     Specifies the location of Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
     information to be used by the client when verifying the validity
     of the KDC certificate presented.  This option may be specified
     multiple times.

pkinit_require_crl_checking
     The default certificate verification process will always check the
     available revocation information to see if a certificate has been
     revoked.  If a match is found for the certificate in a CRL,
     verification fails.  If the certificate being verified is not
     listed in a CRL, or there is no CRL present for its issuing CA,
     and `pkinit_require_crl_checking' is `false', then verification
     succeeds.

     However, if `pkinit_require_crl_checking' is `true' and there is
     no CRL information available for the issuing CA, then verification
     fails.

     `pkinit_require_crl_checking' should be set to `true' if the
     policy is such that up-to-date CRLs must be present for every CA.

pkinit_dh_min_bits
     Specifies the size of the Diffie-Hellman key the client will
     attempt to use.  The acceptable values are currently 1024, 2048,
     and 4096.  The default is 2048.

pkinit_win2k
     This flag specifies whether the target realm is assumed to support
     only the old, pre-RFC version of the protocol.  The default is
     false.

pkinit_win2k_require_binding
     If this flag is set to true, it expects that the target KDC is
     patched to return a reply with a checksum rather than a nonce.
     The default is false.

pkinit_eku_checking
     This option specifies what Extended Key Usage value the KDC
     certificate presented to the client must contain.  (Note that if
     the KDC certificate has the pkinit SubjectAlternativeName encoded
     as the Kerberos TGS name, EKU checking is not necessary since the
     issuing CA has certified this as a KDC certificate.)  The values
     recognized in the `krb5.conf' file are:
    kpKDC
          This is the default value and specifies that the KDC must
          have the id-pkinit-KPKdc EKU as defined in RFC4556.

    kpServerAuth
          If `kpServerAuth' is specified, a KDC certificate with the
          id-kp-serverAuth EKU as used by Microsoft will be accepted.

    none
          If `none' is specified, then the KDC certificate will not be
          checked to verify it has an acceptable EKU.  The use of this
          option is not recommended.

pkinit_kdc_hostname
     The presense of this option indicates that the client is willing to
     accept a KDC certificate with a dNSName SAN (Subject Alternative
     Name) rather than requiring the id-pkinit-san as defined in
     RFC4556.  This option may be specified multiple times.  Its value
     should contain the acceptable hostname for the KDC (as contained
     in its certificate).

pkinit_cert_match
     Specifies matching rules that the client certificate must match
     before it is used to attempt pkinit authentication.  If a user has
     multiple certificates available (on a smart card, or via other
     media), there must be exactly one certificate chosen before
     attempting pkinit authentication.  This option may be specified
     multiple times.  All the available certificates are checked
     against each rule in order until there is a match of exactly one
     certificate.

     The Subject and Issuer comparison strings are the RFC2253 string
     representations from the certificate Subject DN and Issuer DN
     values.

     The syntax of the matching rules is:
          [relation-operator]component-rule `...'
     where
    relation-operator
          can be either `&&', meaning all component rules must match,
          or `||', meaning only one component rule must match.  The
          default is `&&' if not specified.

    component-rule
          can be one of the following.  Note that there is no
          punctuation or whitespace between component rules.
         `<SUBJECT>'regular-expression

         `<ISSUER>'regular-expression

         `<SAN>'regular-expression

         `<EKU>'extended-key-usage-list
               where extended-key-usage-list is a comma-separated list
               of required Extended Key Usage values.  All values in
               the list must be present in the certificate.
                    `pkinit'
                    `msScLogin'
                    `clientAuth'
                    `emailProtection'

         `<KU>'key-usage-list
               where key-usage-list is a comma-separated list of
               required Key Usage values.  All values in the list must
               be present in the certificate.
                    `digitalSignature'
                    `keyEncipherment'
Examples:
          pkinit_cert_match = ||<SUBJECT>.*DoE.*<SAN>.*@EXAMPLE.COM

3.4 kdc.conf
============

The `kdc.conf' file contains KDC configuration information, including
defaults used when issuing Kerberos tickets.  Normally, you should
install your `kdc.conf' file in the directory `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc'.
You can override the default location by setting the environment
variable `KRB5_KDC_PROFILE'.

The `kdc.conf' file is set up in the same format as the `krb5.conf'
file.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)  The `kdc.conf' file may contain any or all
of the following three sections:

kdcdefaults
     Contains default values for overall behavior of the KDC.

realms
     Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm names.  Each
     subsection describes realm-specific information, including where
     to find the Kerberos servers for that realm.

logging
     Contains relations which determine how Kerberos programs are to
     perform logging.

File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: kdcdefaults,  Next: realms (kdc.conf),  Prev: kdc.conf,  Up: kdc.conf

3.4.1 [kdcdefaults]
-------------------

The following relation is defined in the [kdcdefaults] section:

kdc_ports
     This relation lists the ports on which the Kerberos server should
     listen for UDP requests by default.  This list is a comma separated
     list of integers.  If this relation is not specified, the
     compiled-in default is 88,750, the first being the assigned
     Kerberos port and the second which was used by Kerberos V4.

kdc_tcp_ports
     This relation lists the ports on which the Kerberos server should
     listen for TCP connections by default.  This list is a comma
     separated list of integers.  If this relation is not specified,
     the compiled-in default is not to listen for TCP connections at
     all.

     If you wish to change this (which we do not recommend, because the
     current implementation has little protection against
     denial-of-service attacks), the standard port number assigned for
     Kerberos TCP traffic is port 88.  -

3.4.2 [realms]
--------------

Each tag in the [realms] section of the file names a Kerberos realm.
The value of the tag is a subsection where the relations in that
subsection define KDC parameters for that particular realm.

For each realm, the following tags may be specified in the [realms]
subsection:

acl_file
     (String.)  Location of the access control list (acl) file that
     kadmin uses to determine which principals are allowed which
     permissions on the database.  The default is
     `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl'.

admin_keytab
     (String.)  Location of the keytab file that the legacy
     administration daemons `kadmind4' and `v5passwdd' use to
     authenticate to the database.  The default is
     `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab'.

database_name
     (String.)  Location of the Kerberos database for this realm.  The
     default is
     `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal'.

default_principal_expiration
     (Absolute time string.)  Specifies the default expiration date of
     principals created in this realm.  The default value for this tag
     is 0.

default_principal_flags
     (Flag string.)  Specifies the default attributes of principals
     created in this realm.  The format for this string is a
     comma-separated list of flags, with '+' before each flag that
     should be enabled and '-' before each flag that should be
     disabled.   The default is postdateable, forwardable, tgt-based,
     renewable, proxiable, dup-skey, allow-tickets, and service
     enabled..

     There are a number of possible flags:

    postdateable
          Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain
          postdateable tickets.

    forwardable
          Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain forwardable
          tickets.

    tgt-based
          Enabling this flag allows a principal to obtain tickets based
          on a ticket-granting-ticket, rather than repeating the
          authentication process that was used to obtain the TGT.

    renewable
          Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain renewable
          tickets.

    proxiable
          Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain proxy
          tickets.

    dup-skey
          Enabling this flag allows the principal to obtain a session
          key for another user, permitting user-to-user authentication
          for this principal.

    allow-tickets
          Enabling this flag means that the KDC will issue tickets for
          this principal.  Disabling this flag essentially deactivates
          the principal within this realm.

    preauth
          If this flag is enabled on a client principal, then that
          principal is required to preauthenticate to the KDC before
          receiving any tickets.  On a service principal, enabling this
          flag means that service tickets for this principal will only
          be issued to clients with a TGT that has the preauthenticated
          ticket set.

    hwauth
          If this flag is enabled, then the principal is required to
          preauthenticate using a hardware device before receiving any
          tickets.

    pwchange
          Enabling this flag forces a password change for this
          principal.

    service
          Enabling this flag allows the the KDC to issue service
          tickets for this principal.

    pwservice
          If this flag is enabled, it marks this principal as a
          password change service.  This should only be used in special
          cases, for example, if a user's password has expired, then
          the user has to get tickets for that principal without going
          through the normal password authentication in order to be
          able to change the password.


dict_file
     (String.)  Location of the dictionary file containing strings that
     are not allowed as passwords.  If none is specified or if there is
     no policy assigned to the principal, no dictionary checks of
     passwords will be performed.

kadmind_port
     (Port number.)  Specifies the port on which the kadmind daemon is
     to listen for this realm.  The assigned port for kadmind is
     749.

kpasswd_port
     (Port number.)  Specifies the port on which the kpasswd daemon is
     to listen for this realm.  The default is 464.

key_stash_file
     (String.)  Specifies the location where the master key has been
     stored (via `kdb5_util stash').  The default is
     `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/.k5.REALM', where REALM is the Kerberos
     realm.

kdc_ports
     (String.)  Specifies the list of ports that the KDC is to listen to
     for UDP requests for this realm.  By default, the value of
     kdc_ports as specified in the [kdcdefaults] section is used.

kdc_tcp_ports
     (String.)  Specifies the list of ports that the KDC is to listen to
     for TCP requests for this realm.  By default, the value of
     kdc_tcp_ports as specified in the [kdcdefaults] section is used.

master_key_name
     (String.)  Specifies the name of the principal associated with the
     master key.  The default is K/M.

master_key_type
     (Key type string.)  Specifies the master key's key type.  The
     default value for this is des3-cbc-sha1.  For a list of all
     possible values, see *Note Supported Encryption Types::.

max_life
     (Delta time string.)  Specifes the maximum time period for which a
     ticket may be valid in this realm.  The default value is
     24 hours.

max_renewable_life
     (Delta time string.)  Specifies the maximum time period during
     which a valid ticket may be renewed in this realm.  The default
     value is 0.

supported_enctypes
     List of key:salt strings.  Specifies the default key/salt
     combinations of principals for this realm.  Any principals created
     through `kadmin' will have keys of these types.  The default value
     for this tag is aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96:normal
     aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96:normal des3-cbc-sha1:normal
     arcfour-hmac-md5:normal. For lists of possible values, see *Note
     Supported Encryption Types:: and *Note Salts::.

reject_bad_transit
     A boolean value (`true', `false').  If set to `true', the KDC will
     check the list of transited realms for cross-realm tickets against
     the transit path computed from the realm names and the `capaths'
     section of its `krb5.conf' file; if the path in the ticket to be
     issued contains any realms not in the computed path, the ticket
     will not be issued, and an error will be returned to the client
     instead.  If this value is set to `false', such tickets will be
     issued anyways, and it will be left up to the application server to
     validate the realm transit path.

     If the `disable-transited-check' flag is set in the incoming
     request, this check is not performed at all.  Having the
     `reject_bad_transit' option will cause such ticket requests to be
     rejected always.

     This transit path checking and config file option currently apply
     only to TGS requests.

     Earlier versions of the MIT release (before 1.2.3) had bugs in the
     application server support such that the server-side checks may
     not be performed correctly.  We recommend turning this option on,
     unless you know that all application servers in this realm have
     been updated to fixed versions of the software, and for whatever
     reason, you don't want the KDC to do the validation.

     This is a per-realm option so that multiple-realm KDCs may control
     it separately for each realm, in case (for example) one realm has
     had the software on its application servers updated but another
     has not.

     This option defaults to `true'.

3.4.3.1 pkinit kdc.conf options
...............................

For information about the syntax of some of these options, see *Note
pkinit identity syntax::.

pkinit_identity
     Specifies the location of the KDC's X.509 identity information.
     This option is required if pkinit is to be supported by the KDC.

pkinit_anchors
     Specifies the location of trusted anchor (root) certificates which
     the KDC trusts to sign client certificates.  This option is
     required if pkinit is to be supported by the KDC.  This option may
     be specified multiple times.

pkinit_pool
     Specifies the location of intermediate certificates which may be
     used by the KDC to complete the trust chain between a client's
     certificate and a trusted anchor.  This option may be specified
     multiple times.

pkinit_revoke
     Specifies the location of Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
     information to be used by the KDC when verifying the validity of
     client certificates.  This option may be specified multiple times.

pkinit_require_crl_checking
     The default certificate verification process will always check the
     available revocation information to see if a certificate has been
     revoked.  If a match is found for the certificate in a CRL,
     verification fails.  If the certificate being verified is not
     listed in a CRL, or there is no CRL present for its issuing CA,
     and `pkinit_require_crl_checking' is `false', then verification
     succeeds.

     However, if `pkinit_require_crl_checking' is `true' and there is
     no CRL information available for the issuing CA, then verification
     fails.

     `pkinit_require_crl_checking' should be set to `true' if the
     policy is such that up-to-date CRLs must be present for every CA.

pkinit_dh_min_bits
     Specifies the minimum number of bits the KDC is willing to accept
     for a client's Diffie-Hellman key.  The default is 2048.

pkinit_allow_upn
     Specifies that the KDC is willing to accept client certificates
     with the Microsoft UserPrincipalName (UPN) Subject Alternative Name
     (SAN).  This means the KDC accepts the binding of the UPN in the
     certificate to the Kerberos principal name.

     The default is false.

     Without this option, the KDC will only accept certificates with
     the id-pkinit-san as defined in RFC4556.  There is currently no
     option to disable SAN checking in the KDC.

pkinit_eku_checking
     This option specifies what Extended Key Usage (EKU) values the KDC
     is willing to accept in client certificates.  The values
     recognized in the `kdc.conf' file are:
    kpClientAuth
          This is the default value and specifies that client
          certificates must have the id-pkinit-KPClientAuth EKU as
          defined in RFC4556.

    scLogin
          If `scLogin' is specified, client certificates with the
          Microsoft Smart Card Login EKU (id-ms-kp-sc-logon) will be
          accepted.

    none
          If `none' is specified, then client certificates will not be
          checked to verify they have an acceptable EKU.  The use of
          this option is not recommended.

4.1 Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms
==========================================

Mapping hostnames onto Kerberos realms is done in one of two ways.

The first mechanism, which has been in use for years in MIT-based
Kerberos distributions, works through a set of rules in the `krb5.conf'
configuration file.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)  You can specify mappings for
an entire domain or subdomain, and/or on a hostname-by-hostname basis.
Since greater specificity takes precedence, you would do this by
specifying the mappings for a given domain or subdomain and listing the
exceptions.

The second mechanism works by looking up the information in special
`TXT' records in the Domain Name Service.  This is currently not used
by default because security holes could result if the DNS TXT records
were spoofed.  If this mechanism is enabled on the client, it will try
to look up a `TXT' record for the DNS name formed by putting the prefix
`_kerberos' in front of the hostname in question.  If that record is
not found, it will try using `_kerberos' and the host's domain name,
then its parent domain, and so forth.  So for the hostname
BOSTON.ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM, the names looked up would be:

     _kerberos.boston.engineering.foobar.com
     _kerberos.engineering.foobar.com
     _kerberos.foobar.com
     _kerberos.com

The value of the first TXT record found is taken as the realm name.
(Obviously, this doesn't work all that well if a host and a subdomain
have the same name, and different realms.  For example, if all the hosts
in the ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM domain are in the ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM
realm, but a host named ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM is for some reason in
another realm.  In that case, you would set up TXT records for all
hosts, rather than relying on the fallback to the domain name.)

Even if you do not choose to use this mechanism within your site, you
may wish to set it up anyway, for use when interacting with other sites.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Hostnames for KDCs,  Prev: Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms,  Up: Using DNS

4.2 Hostnames for KDCs
======================

MIT recommends that your KDCs have a predefined set of CNAME records
(DNS hostname aliases), such as `kerberos' for the master KDC and
`kerberos-1', `kerberos-2', ... for the slave KDCs.  This way, if you
need to swap a machine, you only need to change a DNS entry, rather
than having to change hostnames.

A new mechanism for locating KDCs of a realm through DNS has been added
to the MIT Kerberos V5 distribution.  A relatively new record type
called `SRV' has been added to DNS.  Looked up by a service name and a
domain name, these records indicate the hostname and port number to
contact for that service, optionally with weighting and prioritization.
(See RFC 2782 if you want more information.  You can follow the
example below for straightforward cases.)

The use with Kerberos is fairly straightforward.  The domain name used
in the SRV record name is the domain-style Kerberos realm name.  (It is
possible to have Kerberos realm names that are not DNS-style names, but
we don't recommend it for Internet use, and our code does not support it
well.)  Several different Kerberos-related service names are used:

`_kerberos._udp'
     This is for contacting any KDC by UDP.  This entry will be used
     the most often.  Normally you should list port 88 on each of your
     KDCs.

`_kerberos._tcp'
     This is for contacting any KDC by TCP.  The MIT KDC by default
     will not listen on any TCP ports, so unless you've changed the
     configuration or you're running another KDC implementation, you
     should leave this unspecified.  If you do enable TCP support,
     normally you should use port 88.

`_kerberos-master._udp'
     This entry should refer to those KDCs, if any, that will
     immediately see password changes to the Kerberos database.  This
     entry is used only in one case, when the user is logging in and
     the password appears to be incorrect; the master KDC is then
     contacted, and the same password used to try to decrypt the
     response, in case the user's password had recently been changed
     and the first KDC contacted hadn't been updated.  Only if that
     fails is an "incorrect password" error given.

     If you have only one KDC, or for whatever reason there is no
     accessible KDC that would get database changes faster than the
     others, you do not need to define this entry.

`_kerberos-adm._tcp'
     This should list port 749 on your master KDC.  Support for it is
     not complete at this time, but it will eventually be used by the
     `kadmin' program and related utilities.  For now, you will also
     need the `admin_server' entry in `krb5.conf'.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)

`_kpasswd._udp'
     This should list port 464 on your master KDC.  It is used when a
     user changes her password.


Be aware, however, that the DNS SRV specification requires that the
hostnames listed be the canonical names, not aliases.  So, for example,
you might include the following records in your (BIND-style) zone file:

     $ORIGIN foobar.com.
     _kerberos               TXT       "FOOBAR.COM"
     kerberos                CNAME     daisy
     kerberos-1              CNAME     use-the-force-luke
     kerberos-2              CNAME     bunny-rabbit
     _kerberos._udp          SRV       0 0 88 daisy
                             SRV       0 0 88 use-the-force-luke
                             SRV       0 0 88 bunny-rabbit
     _kerberos-master._udp   SRV       0 0 88 daisy
     _kerberos-adm._tcp      SRV       0 0 749 daisy
     _kpasswd._udp           SRV       0 0 464 daisy

As with the DNS-based mechanism for determining the Kerberos realm of a
host, we recommend distributing the information this way for use by
other sites that may want to interact with yours using Kerberos, even if
you don't immediately make use of it within your own site.  If you
anticipate installing a very large number of machines on which it will
be hard to update the Kerberos configuration files, you may wish to do
all of your Kerberos service lookups via DNS and not put the information
(except for `admin_server' as noted above) in future versions of your
`krb5.conf' files at all.  Eventually, we hope to phase out the listing
of server hostnames in the client-side configuration files; making
preparations now will make the transition easier in the future.

5 Administrating the Kerberos Database
**************************************

Your Kerberos database contains all of your realm's Kerberos principals,
their passwords, and other administrative information about each
principal.  For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util' program to
manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin' program
to make changes to the entries in the database.  (One notable exception
is that users will use the `kpasswd' program to change their own
passwords.)  The `kadmin' program has its own command-line interface,
to which you type the database administrating commands.

`Kdb5_util' provides a means to create, delete, load, or dump a
Kerberos database.  It also includes a command to stash a copy of the
master database key in a file on a KDC, so that the KDC can authenticate
itself to the `kadmind' and `krb5kdc' daemons at boot time.

`Kadmin' provides for the maintenance of Kerberos principals, KADM5
policies, and service key tables (keytabs).  It exists as both a
Kerberos client, `kadmin', using Kerberos authentication and an RPC, to
operate securely from anywhere on the network, and as a local client,
`kadmin.local', intended to run directly on the KDC without Kerberos
authentication.  `kadmin.local' need not run on the kdc if the database
is LDAP. Other than the fact that the remote client uses Kerberos to
authenticate the person using it, the functionalities of the two
versions are identical. The local version is necessary to enable you to
set up enough of the database to be able to use the remote version.  It
replaces the now obsolete `kdb5_edit' (except for database dump and
load, which are provided by `kdb5_util').

The remote version authenticates to the KADM5 server using the service
principal `kadmin/admin'.  If the credentials cache contains a ticket
for the `kadmin/admin' principal, and the `-c ccache' option is
specified, that ticket is used to authenticate to KADM5.  Otherwise,
the `-p' and `-k' options are used to specify the client Kerberos
principal name used to authenticate.  Once kadmin has determined the
principal name, it requests a `kadmin/admin' Kerberos service ticket
from the KDC, and uses that service ticket to authenticate to KADM5.

5.1 Kadmin Options
==================

You can invoke `kadmin' or `kadmin.local' with any of the following
options:

-r REALM
     Use REALM as the default Kerberos realm for the database.

-p principal
     Use the Kerberos principal principal to authenticate to Kerberos.
     If this option is not given, `kadmin' will append `admin' to
     either the primary principal name, the environment variable USER,
     or to the username obtained from `getpwuid', in order of
     preference.

-q query
     Pass query directly to `kadmin'.  This is useful for writing
     scripts that pass specific queries to `kadmin'.

     You can invoke `kadmin' with any of the following options:

-k [-t keytab]
     Use the keytab keytab to decrypt the KDC response instead of
     prompting for a password on the TTY.  In this case, the principal
     will be `host/hostname'.  If -t is not used to specify a keytab,
     then the default keytab will be used.

-c credentials cache
     Use credentials_cache as the credentials cache.  The credentials
     cache should contain a service ticket for the `kadmin/admin'
     service, which can be acquired with the `kinit' program.  If this
     option is not specified, `kadmin' requests a new service ticket
     from the KDC, and stores it in its own temporary ccache.

-w password
     Use password as the password instead of prompting for one on the
     TTY.  Note:  placing the password for a Kerberos principal with
     administration access into a shell script can be dangerous if
     unauthorized users gain read access to the script.

-x db_args
     Specifies the database specific arguments.

-x host=<hostname>
     Specifies the LDAP server to connect to by a LDAP URI. It is
     recommend to use ldapi:// or ldaps:// interface to connect to the
     LDAP server.

-x binddn=<bind_dn>
     Specifies the Distinguished Name (DN) of the object used by the
     administration server to bind to the LDAP server. This object
     should have the read and write rights on the realm container,
     principal container and realm subtree.

-x bindpwd=<bind_password>
     Specifies the password for the above mentioned binddn. It is
     recommended not to use this option. Instead, the password can be
     stashed using the stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util.

     Note: This database specific argument is applicable only to
     kadmin.local and the KADM5 server.

-s admin_server[:port]
     Specifies the admin server that kadmin should contact.

     You can invoke `kadmin.local' with an of the follwing options:

-d_ dbname
     Specifies the name of the Kerberos database.

-e "enctypes ..."
     Sets the list of cryptosystem and salt types to be used for any new
     keys created.  See *Note Supported Encryption Types:: and *Note
     Salts:: for available types.

-m
     Do not authenticate using a keytab.  This option will cause kadmin
     to prompt for the master database password.

the "inquire" administrative privilege.  The syntax is:

     get_principal principal

The `get_principal' command has the alias `getprinc'.

For example, suppose you wanted to view the attributes of the principal

where expression is a shell-style glob expression that can contain the
characters `*', `?', `[', and `]'.  All policy names matching the
expression are displayed.  The `list_principals' command has the
aliases `listprincs', `get_principals', and `getprincs'.  For example:

5.3.2 Privileges
----------------

Administrative privileges for the Kerberos database are stored in the
file `kadm5.acl'.

The format of the file is:

     Kerberos_principal      permissions     [target_principal]	[restrictions]

The Kerberos principal (and optional target principal) can include the
"*" wildcard, so if you want any principal with the instance "admin" to
have full permissions on the database, you could use the principal
"`*/admin@REALM'" where "REALM" is your Kerberos realm.
`target_principal' can also include backreferences to
`Kerberos_principal', in which "*number" matches the component number
in the `Kerberos_principal'.

Note:  a common use of an admin instance is so you can grant separate
permissions (such as administrator access to the Kerberos database) to
a separate Kerberos principal.  For example, the user `joeadmin' might
have a principal for his administrative use, called `joeadmin/admin'.
This way, `joeadmin' would obtain `joeadmin/admin' tickets only when he
actually needs to use those permissions.

The permissions are represented by single letters; UPPER-CASE letters
represent negative permissions.  The permissions are:

a
     allows the addition of principals or policies in the database.

A
     disallows the addition of principals or policies in the database.

d
     allows the deletion of principals or policies in the database.

D

m
     allows the modification of principals or policies in the database.

M
     disallows the modification of principals or policies in the

     All privileges (admcil).

x
     All privileges (admcil); identical to "*".

The restrictions are a string of flags.  Allowed restrictions are:

[+ -]flagname
     flag is forced to indicated value.  The permissible flags are the
     same as the `+' and `-' flags for the `kadmin addprinc' and
     `modprinc' commands.

-clearpolicy
     policy is forced to clear

-policy pol
     policy is forced to be pol

expire time
pwexpire time
maxlife time
maxrenewlife time
     associated value will be forced to MIN(time, requested value)

The above flags act as restrictions on any add or modify operation
which is allowed due to that ACL line.

Here is an example of a `kadm5.acl' file.  Note that order is
important; permissions are determined by the first matching entry.

     */admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  *
     joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  ADMCIL
     joeadmin/*@ATHENA.MIT.EDU il */root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     *@ATHENA.MIT.EDU cil *1/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     */*@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  i
     */admin@EXAMPLE.COM * -maxlife 9h -postdateable

In the above file, any principal in the ATHENA.MIT.EDU realm with an
`admin' instance has all administrative privileges.  The user `joeadmin'
has all permissions with his `admin' instance,
`joeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU' (matches the first line).  He has no
permissions at all with his `null' instance, `joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
(matches the second line).  His root instance has inquire and list
permissions with any other principal that has the instance `root'.  Any
principal in ATHENA.MIT.EDU can inquire, list, or change the password of
their `admin' instance, but not any other `admin' instance.  Any
principal in the realm `ATHENA.MIT.EDU' (except for
`joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU', as mentioned above) has inquire privileges.
Finally, any principal with an admin instance in EXAMPLE.COM has all
permissions, but any principal that they create or modify will not be
able to get postdateable tickets or tickets with a life of longer than
9 hours.

5.3.3 Adding or Modifying Principals
------------------------------------

To add a principal to the database, use the kadmin `add_principal'
command, which requires the "add" administrative privilege.  This
function creates the new principal, prompting twice for a password, and,
if neither the -policy nor -clearpolicy options are specified and the
policy "default" exists, assigns it that policy.  The syntax is:

     kadmin: add_principal [options] principal

To modify attributes of a principal, use the kadmin `modify_principal'
command, which requires the "modify" administrative privilege.  The
syntax is:

     kadmin: modify_principal [options] principal

`add_principal' has the aliases `addprinc' and `ank'(1).
`modify_principal' has the alias `modprinc'.

The `add_principal' and `modify_principal' commands take the following
switches:

-x db_princ_args
     Denotes the database specific options.  The options for LDAP
     database are:
    -x dn=<dn>
          Specifies the  LDAP object that will contain the Kerberos
          principal being created.

    -x linkdn=<dn>
          Specifies the LDAP object  to which the newly created
          Kerberos principal object will point to.

    -x containerdn=<container_dn>
          Specifies the  container object under which the Kerberos
          principal is to be created.

    -x tktpolicy=<policy>
          Associates a ticket policy to the Kerberos principal.
          Specifying an empty string value clears the ticket policy
          associated with the principal.  Note: * dn and containerdn
          options are not valid while modifying the principal.  *
          containerdn and linkdn options cannot be specified with dn
          option.  *  If dn or containerdn options are not specified
          while adding the principal, the principals are created
          under the prinicipal container configured in the realm or the
          realm container.  * dn and containerdn should be within the
          subtrees or principal container configured in the realm.

-expire date
     Sets the expiration date of the principal to date.

-pwexpire date
     Sets the expiration date of the password to date.

-maxlife maxlife
     Sets the maximum ticket life of the principal to maxlife.

-maxrenewlife maxrenewlife
     Sets the maximum renewable life of tickets for the principal to
     maxrenewlife.

-kvno number
     Explicity sets the key version number to number.  MIT does not
     recommend doing this unless there is a specific reason.

-policy policy
     Sets the policy used by this principal.  (*Note Policies::.)  With
     `modify_principal', the current policy assigned to the principal is
     set or changed.  With `add_principal', if this option is not
     supplied, the -clearpolicy is not specified, and the policy
     "default" exists, that policy is assigned.  If a principal is
     created with no policy, `kadmin' will print a warning message.

-clearpolicy
     For `modify_principal', removes the current policy from a
     principal.  For `add_principal', suppresses the automatic
     assignment of the policy "default".

{-|+}allow_postdated
     The "-allow_postdated" option prohibits this principal from
     obtaining postdated tickets.  "+allow_postdated" clears this flag.
     In effect, "-allow_postdated" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_POSTDATED flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}allow_forwardable
     The "-allow_forwardable" option prohibits this principal from
     obtaining forwardable tickets.  "+allow_forwardable" clears this
     flag.  In effect, "-allow_forwardable" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_FORWARDABLE flag on the principal in the
     database.

{-|+}allow_renewable
     The "-allow_renewable" option prohibits this principal from
     obtaining renewable tickets.  "+allow_renewable" clears this flag.
     In effect, "-allow_renewable" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_RENEWABLE flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}allow_proxiable
     The "-allow_proxiable" option prohibits this principal from
     obtaining proxiable tickets.  "+allow_proxiable" clears this flag.
     In effect, "-allow_proxiable" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_PROXIABLE flag. on the principal in the database.

{-|+}allow_dup_skey
     The "-allow_dup_skey" option disables user-to-user authentication
     for this principal by prohibiting this principal from obtaining a
     session key for another user.  "+allow_dup_skey" clears this flag.
     In effect, "-allow_dup_skey" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_DUP_SKEY flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}requires_preauth
     The "+requires_preauth" option requires this principal to
     preauthenticate before being allowed to kinit.  -requires_preauth
     clears this flag.  In effect, +requires_preauth sets the
     KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_PRE_AUTH flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}requires_hwauth
     The "+requires_hwauth" flag requires the principal to
     preauthenticate using a hardware device before being allowed to
     kinit.  "-requires_hwauth" clears this flag.  In effect,
     "+requires_hwauth" sets the KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_HW_AUTH flag on the
     principal in the database.

{-|+}allow_svr
     The "-allow_svr" flag prohibits the issuance of service tickets for
     this principal.  "+allow_svr" clears this flag.  In effect,
     "-allow_svr" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_SVR flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}allow_tgs_req
     The "-allow_tgs_req" option specifies that a Ticket-Granting
     Service (TGS) request for a service ticket for this principal is
     not permitted.  You will probably never need to use this option.
     "+allow_tgs_req" clears this flag.  The default is
     "+allow_tgs_req".  In effect, "-allow_tgs_req" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_TGT_BASED flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}allow_tix
     The "-allow_tix" option forbids the issuance of any tickets for
     this principal.  "+allow_tix" clears this flag.  The default is
     "+allow_tix".  In effect, "-allow_tix" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_ALL_TIX flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}needchange
     The "+needchange" option sets a flag in attributes field to force a
     password change; "-needchange" clears it.  The default is
     "-needchange".  In effect, "+needchange" sets the
     KRB5_KDB_REQUIRES_PWCHANGE flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}password_changing_service
     The "+password_changing_service" option sets a flag in the
     attributes field marking this principal as a password change
     service. (Again, you will probably never need to use this option.)
     "-password_changing_service" clears the flag.  The default is
     "-password_changing_service".  In effect, the
     "+password_changing_service" option sets the
     KRB5_KDB_PWCHANGE_SERVICE flag on the principal in the database.

{-|+}ok_as_delegate
     The "+ok_as_delegate" option sets a flag in tickets issued for the
     service principal.  Some client programs may recognize this flag as
     indicating that it is okay to delegate credentials to the service.
     If ok_as_delegate is set on a cross-realm TGT, it indicates that
     the foreign realm's ok_as_delegate flags should be honored by
     clients in the local realm.  The default is "-ok_as_delegate".

-randkey
     Sets the key for the principal to a random value (`add_principal'
     only).  MIT recommends using this option for host keys.

-pw password
     Sets the key of the principal to the specified string and does not
     prompt for a password (`add_principal' only).  MIT does not
     recommend using this option.

-e enc:salt...
     Uses the specified list of enctype-salttype pairs for setting the
     key of the principal.  The quotes are necessary if there are
     multiple enctype-salttype pairs.  This will not function against
     kadmin daemons earlier than krb5-1.2.  See *Note Supported
     Encryption Types:: and *Note Salts:: for available types.

If you want to just use the default values, all you need to do is:

     kadmin: addprinc jennifer
     WARNING: no policy specified for "jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Enter password for principal jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type the password.
     Re-enter password for principal jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <=Type it again.
     Principal "jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin:

If you want to create a principal which is contained by a  LDAP object,
all you need to do is:

     kadmin: addprinc -x dn=cn=jennifer,dc=example,dc=com jennifer
     WARNING: no policy specified for "jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Enter password for principal jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type the password.
     Re-enter password for principal jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <=Type it again.
     Principal "jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin:

If you want to create a principal under a specific LDAP container and
link to an existing LDAP object, all you need to do is:

     kadmin: addprinc -x containerdn=dc=example,dc=com -x linkdn=cn=david,dc=example,dc=com david
     WARNING: no policy specified for "david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     defaulting to no policy.
     Enter password for principal david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type the password.
     Re-enter password for principal david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <=Type it again.
     Principal "david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin:

If you want to associate a ticket policy to a principal, all you need
to do is:

     kadmin: modprinc -x tktpolicy=userpolicy david
     Principal "david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" modified.
     kadmin:

If, on the other hand, you want to set up an account that expires on
January 1, 2000, that uses a policy called "stduser", with a temporary
password (which you want the user to change immediately), you would type
the following.  (Note:  each line beginning with => is a continuation
of the previous line.)


     kadmin: addprinc david -expire "1/1/2000 12:01am EST" -policy stduser
     =>  +needchange
     Enter password for principal david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type the password.
     Re-enter password for principal
     david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type it again.
     Principal "david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin:

If you will need cross-realm authentication, you need to add principals
for the other realm's TGT to each realm.  For example, if you need to
do cross-realm authentication between the realms ATHENA.MIT.EDU and
EXAMPLE.COM, you would need to add the principals
`krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@ATHENA.MIT.EDU' and
`krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@EXAMPLE.COM' to both databases.  You need to be
sure the passwords and the key version numbers (kvno) are the same in
both databases.  This may require explicitly setting the kvno with the
`-kvno' option.  See *Note Cross-realm Authentication:: for more
details.

5.3.4 Deleting Principals
-------------------------

To delete a principal, use the kadmin `delete_principal' command, which
requires the "delete" administrative privilege.  The syntax is:

     delete_principal [-force] principal

`delete_principal' has the alias `delprinc'.  The `-force' option
causes `delete_principal' not to ask if you're sure.  For example:

     kadmin: delprinc jennifer
     Are you sure you want to delete the principal
     "jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU"? (yes/no): yes
     Principal "jennifer@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" deleted.
     Make sure that you have removed this principal from
     all ACLs before reusing.
     kadmin:


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Changing Passwords,  Prev: Deleting Principals,  Up: Principals

5.3.5 Changing Passwords
------------------------

To change a principal's password use the kadmin `change_password'
command, which requires the "modify" administrative privilege (unless
the principal is changing his/her own password).  The syntax is:

     change_password [options] principal

The `change_password' option has the alias `cpw'.  `change_password'
takes the following options:

-randkey
     Sets the key of the principal to a random value.

-pw password
     Sets the password to the string password.  MIT does not recommend
     using this option.

-e "enc:salt..."
     Uses the specified list of enctype-salttype pairs for setting the
     key of the principal.  The quotes are necessary if there are
     multiple enctype-salttype pairs.  This will not function against
     kadmin daemons earlier than krb5-1.2.  See *Note Supported
     Encryption Types:: and *Note Salts:: for possible values.

-keepold
     Keeps the previous kvno's keys around.  There is no easy way to
     delete the old keys, and this flag is usually not necessary except
     perhaps for TGS keys.  Don't use this flag unless you know what
     you're doing. This option is not supported for the LDAP database


For example:

     kadmin: cpw david
     Enter password for principal david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type the new password.
     Re-enter password for principal david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type it again.
     Password for david@ATHENA.MIT.EDU changed.
     kadmin:

Note that `change_password' will not let you change the password to one
that is in the principal's password history.

5.4 Policies
============

A policy is a set of rules governing passwords.  Policies can dictate
minimum and maximum password lifetimes, minimum number of characters and
character classes a password must contain, and the number of old
passwords kept in the database.

File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Retrieving Policies,  Next: Retrieving the List of Policies,  Prev: Policies,  Up: Policies

5.4.1 Retrieving Policies
-------------------------

To retrieve a policy, use the kadmin `get_policy' command, which
requires the "inquire" administrative privilege.  The syntax is:

     get_policy [-terse] policy

The `get_policy' command has the alias `getpol'.  For example:

     kadmin: get_policy admin
     Policy: admin
     Maximum password life: 180 days 00:00:00
     Minimum password life: 00:00:00
     Minimum password length: 6
     Minimum number of password character classes: 2
     Number of old keys kept: 5
     Reference count: 17
     kadmin:

The "reference count" is the number of principals using that policy.

The `get_policy' command has a `-terse' option, which lists each field
as a quoted, tab-separated string.  For example:

     kadmin: get_policy -terse admin
     admin   15552000        0       6       2       5       17
     kadmin:


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Retrieving the List of Policies,  Next: Adding or Modifying Policies,  Prev: Retrieving Policies,  Up: Policies

5.4.2 Retrieving the List of Policies
-------------------------------------

You can retrieve the list of policies with the kadmin `list_policies'
command, which requires the "list" privilege.  The syntax is:

     list_policies [expression]

where expression is a shell-style glob expression that can contain the
characters *, ?, and [].  All policy names matching the expression are
displayed.  The `list_policies' command has the aliases `listpols',
`get_policies', and `getpols'.  For example:

     kadmin:  listpols
     test-pol
     dict-only
     once-a-min
     test-pol-nopw

     kadmin:  listpols t*
     test-pol
     test-pol-nopw
     kadmin:


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Adding or Modifying Policies,  Next: Deleting Policies,  Prev: Retrieving the List of Policies,  Up: Policies

5.4.3 Adding or Modifying Policies
----------------------------------

To add a new policy, use the kadmin `add_policy' command, which
requires the "add" administrative privilege.  The syntax is:

     add_policy [options] policy_name

To modify attributes of a principal, use the kadmin `modify_policy'
command, which requires the "modify" administrative privilege.  The
syntax is:

     modify_policy [options] policy_name

`add_policy' has the alias `addpol'.  `modify_poilcy' has the alias
`modpol'.

The `add_policy' and `modify_policy' commands take the following
switches:

-maxlife time
     Sets the maximum lifetime of a password to time.

-minlife time
     Sets the minimum lifetime of a password to time.

-minlength length
     Sets the minimum length of a password to length characters.

-minclasses number
     Requires at least number of character classes in a password.

-history number
     Sets the number of past keys kept for a principal to number. This
     option is not supported for LDAP database.

Note: The policies are created under realm container in the LDAP
database.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Deleting Policies,  Prev: Adding or Modifying Policies,  Up: Policies

5.4.4 Deleting Policies
-----------------------

To delete a policy, use the `kadmin' `delete_policy' command, which
requires the "delete" administrative privilege.  The syntax is:

     delete_policy [-force] policy_name

The `delete_policy' command has the alias `delpol'.  It prompts for
confirmation before deletion.  For example:

     kadmin: delete_policy guests
     Are you sure you want to delete the policy "guests"?
     (yes/no): yes
     kadmin:

Note that you must cancel the policy from all principals before deleting
it.  The `delete_policy' command will fail if it is in use by any
principals.

==============================================

* Menu:

* Dumping a Kerberos Database to a File::
* Restoring a Kerberos Database from a Dump File::
* Creating a Stash File::
* Creating and Destroying a Kerberos Database::

The `kdb5_util' command is the primary tool for administrating the
Kerberos database.  The syntax is:

     kdb5_util command [kdb5_util_options] [command_options]

The `kdb5_util' command takes the following options, which override the
defaults specified in the configuration files:

-r realm
     specifies the the Kerberos realm of the database.

-d database_name
     specifies the name under which the principal database is stored.

-k master_key_type
     specifies the key type of the master key in the database.

-M master_key_name
     specifies the principal name of the master key in the database.

-m
     indicates that the master database password should be read from
     the TTY rather than fetched from a file on disk.

-sf stash_file
     specifies the stash file of the master database password

-P password
     specifies the master database password.  MIT does not recommend
     using this option.



File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Dumping a Kerberos Database to a File,  Next: Restoring a Kerberos Database from a Dump File,  Prev: Global Operations on the Kerberos Database,  Up: Global Operations on the Kerberos Database

5.5.1 Dumping a Kerberos Database to a File
-------------------------------------------

To dump a Kerberos database into a file, use the `kdb5_util' `dump'
command on one of the KDCs.  The syntax is:

     kdb5_util dump [-old] [-b6] [-b7] [-ov]
     [-verbose] [-mkey_convert] [-new_mkey_file] [filename
     [principals...]]

The `kdb5_util dump' command takes the following options:

-old
     causes the dump to be in the Kerberos 5 Beta 5 and earlier dump
     format ("kdb5_edit load_dump version 2.0").

-b6
     causes the dump to be in the Kerberos 5 Beta 6 format ("kdb5_edit
     load_dump version 3.0").

-b7
     causes the dump to be in the Kerberos 5 Beta 7 format ("kdbt_edit
     load_dump version 4").

-ov
     causes the dump to be in ovsec_adm_export format.  Currently, the
     only way to preserve per-principal policy information is to use
     this in conjunction with a normal dump.

-verbose
     causes the name of each principal and policy to be printed as it is
     dumped.

-mkey_convert
     prompts for a new master password, and then dumps the database with
     all keys reencrypted in this new master key

-new_mkey_file
     reads a new key from the default keytab and then dumps the database
     with all keys reencrypted in this new master key

For example:

     shell% kdb5_util dump dumpfile
     shell%

     shell% kbd5_util dump -verbose dumpfile
     kadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     kadmin/history@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     kadmin/changepw@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     shell%

If you specify which principals to dump, you must use the full
principal, as in the following example.  (The line beginning with => is
a continuation of the previous line.):

     shell% kdb5_util dump -verbose dumpfile K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     => kadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     kadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     shell%

Otherwise, the principals will not match those in the database and will
not be dumped:

     shell% kdb5_util dump -verbose dumpfile K/M kadmin/admin
     shell%

If you do not specify a dump file, `kdb5_util' will dump the database
to the standard output.

There is currently a bug where the default dump format omits the
per-principal policy information.  In order to dump all the data
contained in the Kerberos database, you must perform a normal dump (with
no option flags) and an additional dump using the "-ov" flag to a
different file.

5.5.2 Restoring a Kerberos Database from a Dump File
----------------------------------------------------

To restore a Kerberos database dump from a file, use the `kdb5_util'
`load' command on one of the KDCs.  The syntax is:

     kdb5_util load [-old] [-b6] [-b7] [-ov] [-verbose]
     [-update] [-hash] dumpfilename dbname [admin_dbname]

The `kdb5_util load' command takes the following options:

-old
     requires the dump to be in the Kerberos 5 Beta 5 and earlier dump
     format ("kdb5_edit load_dump version 2.0").

-b6
     requires the dump to be in the Kerberos 5 Beta 6 format ("kdb5_edit
     load_dump version 3.0").

-b7
     requires the dump to be in the Kerberos 5 Beta 7 format ("kdb5_edit
     load_dump version 4").

-ov
     requires the dump to be in ovsec_adm_export format.

-verbose
     causes the name of each principal and policy to be printed as it is
     loaded.

-update
     causes records from the dump file to be updated in or added to the
     existing database.  This is useful in conjunction with an
     ovsec_adm_export format dump if you want to preserve per-principal
     policy information, since the current default format does not
     contain this data.

-hash
     causes the database to be stored as a hash rather than a binary
     tree.

For example:

     shell% kdb5_util load dumpfile principal
     shell%

     shell% kdb5_util load -update dumpfile principal
     shell%

If the database file exists, and the -update flag was not given,
`kdb5_util' will overwrite the existing database.

5.5.3 Creating a Stash File
---------------------------

A stash file allows a KDC to authenticate itself to the database
utilities, such as `kadmin', `kadmind', `krb5kdc', and `kdb5_util'.

To create a stash file, use the `kdb5_util' `stash' command.  The
syntax is:

     kdb5_util stash [-f keyfile]

For example:

     shell% kdb5_util stash
     kdb5_util: Cannot find/read stored master key while reading master key
     kdb5_util: Warning: proceeding without master key
     Enter KDC database master key:  <= Type the KDC database master password.
     shell%

If you do not specify a stash file, `kdb5_util' will stash the key in
the file specified in your `kdc.conf' file.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Creating and Destroying a Kerberos Database,  Prev: Creating a Stash File,  Up: Global Operations on the Kerberos Database

5.5.4 Creating and Destroying a Kerberos Database
-------------------------------------------------

If you need to create a new Kerberos database, use the `kdb5_util'
`create' command.  The syntax is:

     kdb5_util create [-s]

If you specify the `-s' option, `kdb5_util' will stash a copy of the
master key in a stash file.  (*Note Creating a Stash File::.)  For
example:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util -r ATHENA.MIT.EDU create -s
     kdb5_util: No such file or directory while setting active database to
     => '/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal'
     Initializing database '/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal' for
     => realm 'ATHENA.MIT.EDU',
     master key name 'K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
     You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
     It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.
     Enter KDC database master key:  <= Type the master password.
     Re-enter KDC database master key to verify:  <= Type it again.
     shell%

If you need to destroy the current Kerberos database, use the
`kdb5_util' `destroy' command.  The syntax is:

     kdb5_util destroy [-f]

The `destroy' command destroys the database, first overwriting the disk

5.6 Global Operations on the Kerberos LDAP Database
===================================================

The `kdb5_ldap_util' is the primary tool for administrating the
Kerberos LDAP database. It allows an administrator to manage realms,
Kerberos services ( KDC and Admin Server) and ticket policies.  The
syntax is:
     kdb5_ldap_util [-D user_dn [-w passwd]] [-H ldap_uri] command [command_options]

-D user_dn
     Specifies the Distinguished Name (DN) of the user who has
     sufficient rights to perform the operation on the LDAP server.

-w passwd
     Specifies the password of user_dn. This option is not recommended.

-H ldap_uri
     Specifies the URI of the LDAP server. It is recommended to use
     ldapi:// or ldaps:// to connect to the LDAP server.

5.6.1 Creating a Kerberos Realm
-------------------------------

If you need to create a new realm, use the command as follows:

     create  [-r realm]  [-subtrees subtree_dn_list] [-sscope search_scope] [-containerref container_reference_dn]
     [-k  mkeytype] [-m|-P password][-sf stashlename] [-s] [-maxtktlife max_ticket_life]
     [-maxrenewlife  max_renewable_ticket_life] [ticket_flags]

Options to create realm in directory are as follows:

-r realm
     Specifies the Kerberos realm of the database; by default the realm
     returned by `krb5_default_local_realm' (3) is used.

-subtrees subtree_dn_list
     Specifies the list of subtrees containing principals of a realm.
     The list contains the DN of the subtree objects separated by
     colon(:).

-sscope search_scope
     Specifies the scope for searching the principals under the
     subtree. The possible values are 1 or one (one level), 2 or sub
     (subtree).

-containerref container_reference_dn
     Specfies the DN of the container object in which the principals of
     a realm will be created. If the container reference is not
     configured for a realm, the principals will be created in the
     realm container.

-k mkeytype
     Specifies the key type of the master key in the database; the
     default is that given in `kdc.conf'.

-m
     Specifies that the master database password should be read from
     the TTY rather than fetched from a file on disk.

-p password
     Specifies the master database password. This option is not
     recommended.

-sf stashfilename
     Specifies the stash file of the master database password.

-s
     Specifies that the stash file is to be created.

-maxtktlife max_ticket_life
     Specifies maximum ticket life for principals in this realm. This
     value is used, if it is not set on the principal.

-maxrenewlife max_renewable_ticket_life
     Specifies maximum renewable life of tickets for principals in this
     realm. This value is used, if it is not set on the principal.

ticket_flags
     Specifies the ticket flags. If this option is not specified, by
     default, none of the flags are set. This means all the ticket
     options will be allowed and no restriction will be set. This value
     is used, if it is not set on the principal.  The various flags are:
    {-|+}allow_postdated
          `-allow_postdated' prohibits principals from obtaining
          postdated tickets. (Sets the `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_POSTDATED'
          flag.).`+allow_postdated' clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_forwardable
          `-allow_forwardable' prohibits principals from obtaining
          forwardable tickets. (Sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_FORWARDABLE' flag.) `+allow_forwardable'
          clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_renewable
          `-allow_renewable' prohibits principals from obtaining
          renewable tickets. (Sets the `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_RENEWABLE'
          flag.) `+allow_renewable' clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_proxiable
          `-allow_proxiable' prohibits principals from obtaining
          proxiable tickets. (Sets the `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_PROXABLE'
          flag.) `+allow_proxiable' clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_dup_skey
          `-allow_dup_skey' disables user-to-user authentication for
          principals by prohibiting principals from obtaining a
          sessions key for another user.  (Sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_DUP_SKEY' flag.)  `+allow_dup_skey' clears
          this flag.

    {-|+}requires_preauth
          `+requires_preauth' requires principals to preauthenticate
          before being allowed to kinit. (Sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_REQURES_PRE_AUTH' flag.) `-requires_preauth' clears
          this flag.

    {-|+}requires_hwauth
          `+requires_hwauth' requires principals to preauthenticate
          using a hardware device before being allowed to kinit. (Sets
          the `KRB5_KDB_REQURES_HW_AUTH' flag.)  `-requires_hwauth'
          clears this flag.

    {-|+}ok_as_delegate
          `+ok_as_delegate' sets the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag on tickets
          issued for use with this principal as the service, which
          clients may use as a hint that credentials can and should be
          delegated when authenticating to the service.  (Sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_OK_AS_DELEGATE' flag.) `-ok_as_delegate' clears
          this flag.

    {-|+}allow_svr
          `-allow_svr' prohibits the issuance of service tickets for
          principals. (Sets the `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_SVR' flag.)
          `+allow_svr' clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_tgs_req
          `-allow_tgs_req' specifies that a "Ticket-Granting Service
          (TGS)" request for a service ticket for principals is not
          permitted. This option is useless for most
          things.`+allow_tgs_req' clears this flag.  The default is
          `+allow_tgs_req'. In effect, `-allow_tgs_req' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_TGT_BASED' flag on principals in the
          database.

    {-|+}allow_tix

          principals. `+allow_tix' clears this flag. The default is
          `+allow_tix'.  In effect, `-allow_tix' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_ALL_TIX' flag on principals in the
          database.

    {-|+}needchange
          `+needchange' sets a flag in attributes field to force a
          password change; `-needchange' clears it. The default is
          `-needchange'. In effect, `+needchange' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_REQURES_PWCHANGE' flag on principals in the
          database.

    {-|+}password_changing_service
          `+password_changing_service' sets a flag in the attributes
          field marking principal as a password change service
          principal (useless for most things).
          `-password_changing_service' clears the flag. This flag
          intentionally has a long name. The default is
          `-password_changing_service'. In effect,
          `+password_changing_service' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_PWCHANGE_SERVICE' flag on principals in the
          database.

          proxiable tickets. (Sets the `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_PROXABLE'
          flag.) `+allow_proxiable' clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_dup_skey
          `-allow_dup_skey' Disables user-to-user authentication for
          principals by prohibiting principals from obtaining a
          sessions key for another user. (Sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_DUP_SKEY' flag.). `+allow_dup_skey' clears
          This flag.

    {-|+}requires_preauth
          `+requires_preauth' requires principals to preauthenticate
          before being allowed to kinit. (Sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_REQURES_PRE_AUTH' flag.)  `-requires_preauth'
          clears this flag.

    {-|+}requires_hwauth
          `+requires_hwauth' requires principals to preauthenticate
          using a hardware device before being allowed to kinit. (Sets
          the `KRB5_KDB_REQURES_HW_AUTH' flag.)  `-requires_hwauth'
          clears this flag.

    {-|+}allow_svr
          `-allow_svr' prohibits the issuance of service tickets for
          principals. (Sets the `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_SVR' flag.)
          `+allow_svr' clears This flag.

    {-|+}allow_tgs_req
          `-allow_tgs_req' specifies that a "Ticket-Granting Service
          (TGS)" request for a service ticket for principals is not
          permitted. This option is useless for most
          things.`+allow_tgs_req' clears this flag.  The default is
          `+allow_tgs_req'.  In effect, `-allow_tgs_req' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_TGT_BASED' flag on principals in the
          database.

    {-|+}allow_tix
          `-allow_tix' forbids the issuance of any tickets for
          principals.  `+allow_tix' clears this flag.  The default is
          `+allow_tix'.  In effect, `-allow_tix' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_DISALLOW_ALL_TIX' flag on principals in the
          database.

    {-|+}needchange

          password change; `-needchange' clears it. The default is
          `-needchange'.  In effect, `+needchange' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_REQURES_PWCHANGE' flag on principals in the
          database.

    {-|+}password_changing_service
          `+password_changing_service' sets a flag in the attributes
          field marking principal as a password change service
          principal (useless for most things).
          `-password_changing_service' clears the flag.  This flag
          intentionally has a long name.  The default is
          `-password_changing_service'.  In effect,
          `+password_changing_service' sets the
          `KRB5_KDB_PWCHANGE_SERVICE' flag on principals in the
          database.

5.7 Cross-realm Authentication
==============================

In order for a KDC in one realm to authenticate Kerberos users in a
different realm, it must share a key with the KDC in the other realm.
In both databases, there must be krbtgt service principals for realms.
These principals should all have the same passwords, key version
numbers, and encryption types.  For example, if the administrators of
ATHENA.MIT.EDU and EXAMPLE.COM wanted to authenticate across the
realms, they would run the following commands on the KDCs in both
realms:

     shell%: kadmin.local -e "des3-hmac-sha1:normal des-cbc-crc:v4"
     kadmin: addprinc -requires_preauth krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@EXAMPLE.COM
     Enter password for principal krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@EXAMPLE.COM:
     Re-enter password for principal krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@EXAMPLE.COM:
     kadmin: addprinc -requires_preauth krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     Enter password for principal krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:
     Enter password for principal krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:
     kadmin:

Even if most principals in a realm are generally created with the
requires_preauth flag enabled, this flag is not desirable on
cross-realm authentication keys because doing so makes it impossible to
disable preauthentication on a service-by-service basis.  Disabling it
as in the example above is recommended.

It is also very important that these principals have good passwords.
MIT recommends that TGT principal passwords be at least 26 characters
of random ASCII text.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Changing the krbtgt Key,  Prev: Cross-realm Authentication,  Up: Administrating the Kerberos Database

5.8 Changing the krbtgt Key
===========================

A Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) is a service ticket for the
principal krbtgt/REALM.  The key for this principal is created when the
Kerberos database is initialized and need not be changed.  However, it
will only have the encryption types supported by the KDC at the time of
the initial database creation.  To allow use of newer encryption types
for the TGT, this key has to be changed.

Changing this key using the normal `kadmin change_password' command
would invalidate any previously issued TGTs.  Therefore, when changing
this key, normally one should use the -keepold flag to
`change_password' to retain the previous key in the database as well as
the new key.  For example:

     kadmin: change_password -randkey -keepold krbtgt/ATHENA.MIT.EDU@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

There is currently no way to remove the old key without running
`change_password' without the -keepold flag (and thereby invalidating
all existing TGTs).  After issuing this command, the old key is still
valid and is still vulnerable to (for instance) brute force attacks.
To completely retire an old key or encryption type, it's therefore
currently necessary to declare a flag day, run `change_password'
without the -keepold flag, and force all users to acquire new tickets.

6 Configuring Kerberos with OpenLDAP back-end
*********************************************

  1. Set up SSL on the OpenLDAP server and client to ensure secure
     communication when the KDC service and LDAP server are on different
     machines. `ldapi://' can be used if the LDAP server and KDC
     service are running on the same machine.

       A. Setting up SSL on the OpenLDAP server:

            a. Get a CA certificate using OpenSSL tools

            b. Configure OpenLDAP server for using SSL/TLS

               For the latter, you need to specify the location of CA
               certificate location in slapd.conf file.

               Refer to the following link for more information:

               `http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/tls.html'

       B. Setting up SSL on OpenLDAP Client:

            a. For the KDC and Admin Server, you need to do the
               client-side configuration in ldap.conf.

               For example,
                    TLS_CACERT `/etc/openldap/certs/cacert.pem'

  2. Include the Kerberos schema file (kerberos.schema) in the
     configuration file (slapd.conf) on the LDAP Server, by providing
     the location where it is stored.

          include `/etc/openldap/schema/kerberos.schema'

  3. Choose DNs for the KDC and kadmin servers to bind to the LDAP
     server, and create them if necessary.  These DNs will be specified
     with the `ldap_kdc_dn' and `ldap_kadmind_dn' directives in
     krb5.conf; their passwords can be stashed with `kdb5_ldap_util
     stashsrvpw' and the resulting file specified with the
     `ldap_service_password_file' directive.

  4. Choose a DN for the global Kerberos container entry (but do not
     create the entry at this time).  This DN will be specified with the
     `ldap_kerberos_container_dn' directive in krb5.conf.  Realm
     container entries will be created underneath this DN.  Principal
     entries may exist either underneath the realm container (the
     default) or in separate trees referenced from the realm container.

  5. Configure the LDAP server ACLs to enable the KDC and kadmin server
     DNs to read and write the Kerberos data.



     Sample access control information

          access to dn.base=""
                  by * read

          access to dn.base="cn=Subschema"
                  by * read

          access to attrs=userPassword,userPKCS12
                  by self write
                  by * auth

          access to attrs=shadowLastChange
                  by self write
                  by * read

          # Providing access to realm container
          access to `dn.subtree'= "cn=EXAMPLE.COM,cn=krbcontainer,dc=example,dc=com"
                  by `dn.exact'="cn=kdc-service,dc=example,dc=com" read
                  by `dn.exact'="cn=adm-service,dc=example,dc=com" write
                  by * none

          # Providing access to principals, if not underneath realm container
          access to `dn.subtree'= "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
                  by `dn.exact'="cn=kdc-service,dc=example,dc=com" read
                  by `dn.exact'="cn=adm-service,dc=example,dc=com" write
                  by * none

          access to *
                  by * read

     If the locations of the container and principals or the DNs of the
service objects for a realm are changed then this information should be
updated.

  6. Start the LDAP server as follows:
          slapd -h "ldapi:/// ldaps:///"

  7. Modify the krb5.conf file to include LDAP specific items listed
     below:
          `realms'
          `database_module'
          `dbmodules'
          `db_library'
          `db_module_dir'
          `ldap_kdc_dn'
          `ldap_kadmind_dn'
          `ldap_service_password_file'
          `ldap_servers'
          `ldap_conns_per_server'

     For the sample `krb5.conf' file, refer to *Note Sample krb5.conf
     File::.  For more details, refer to the section `krb5.conf'

  8. Create the realm using `kdb5_ldap_util'.

          kdb5_ldap_util -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com create -subtrees ou=users,dc=example,dc=com -r EXAMPLE.COM -s

     Use the `-subtrees' option if the principals are to exist in a
     separate subtree from the realm container.  Before executing the
     command, make sure that the subtree mentioned above
     `(ou=users,dc=example,dc=com)' exists.  If the principals will
     exist underneath the realm container, omit the `-subtrees' option
     and do not worry about creating the principal subtree.

     For more information, refer to the section "Global Operations on
     the Kerberos LDAP Database".

     The realm object is created under the ldap_kerberos_container_dn
     specified in the configuration file. This operation will also
     create the Kerberos container, if not present already. This will
     be used to store information related to all realms.

  9. Stash the password of the service object used by the KDC and
     Administration service to bind to the LDAP server using the
     stashsrvpw command of kdb5_ldap_util. The object DN should be the
     same as ldap_kdc_dn and ldap_kadmind_dn values specified in the
     krb5.conf file.

          kdb5_ldap_util -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com stashsrvpw -f `/etc/kerberos/service.keyfile' cn=krbadmin,dc=example,dc=com

 10. Add krb5principalname to the indexes in slapd.conf to speed up the
     access.

With the LDAP back end it is possible to provide aliases for principal
entries.  Currently we provide no mechanism provided for creating
aliases, so it must be done by direct manipulation of the LDAP entries.

An entry with aliases contains multiple values of the krbPrincipalName
attribute.  Since LDAP attribute values are not ordered, it is
necessary to specify which principal name is canonical, by using the
krbCanonicalName attribute.  Therefore, to create aliases for an entry,
first set the krbCanonicalName attribute of the entry to the canonical
principal name (which should be identical to the pre-existing
krbPrincipalName value), and then add additional krbPrincipalName
attributes for the aliases.

Principal aliases are only returned by the KDC when the client requests
canonicalization.  Canonicalization is normally requested for service
principals; for client principals, an explicit flag is often required
(e.g. `kinit -C') and canonicalization is only performed for initial
ticket requests.

7 Application Servers
*********************

If you need to install the Kerberos V5 programs on an application
server, please refer to the Kerberos V5 Installation Guide.  Once you
have installed the software, you need to add that host to the Kerberos
database (*note Adding or Modifying Principals::), and generate a
"keytab" for that host, that contains the host's key.  You also need to
make sure the host's clock is within your maximum clock skew of the
KDCs.

7.1 Keytabs
===========

A "keytab" is a host's copy of its own keylist, which is analogous to a
user's password.  An application server that needs to authenticate
itself to the KDC has to have a keytab that contains its own principal
and key.  Just as it is important for users to protect their passwords,
it is equally important for hosts to protect their keytabs.  You should
always store keytab files on local disk, and make them readable only by
root, and you should never send a keytab file over a network in the
clear.  Ideally, you should run the `kadmin' command to extract a
keytab on the host on which the keytab is to reside.

* Adding Principals to Keytabs::
* Removing Principals from Keytabs::


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Adding Principals to Keytabs,  Next: Removing Principals from Keytabs,  Prev: Keytabs,  Up: Keytabs

7.1.1 Adding Principals to Keytabs
----------------------------------

To generate a keytab, or to add a principal to an existing keytab, use
the `ktadd' command from `kadmin', which requires the "inquire"
administrative privilege.  (If you use the -glob princ_exp option, it
also requires the "list" administrative privilege.)  The syntax is:

     ktadd [-k[eytab] keytab] [-q] [-e
     key:salt_list] [principal | -glob princ_exp]
     [...]

The `ktadd' command takes the following switches:

-k[eytab] keytab
     use keytab as the keytab file.  Otherwise, `ktadd' will use the
     default keytab file (`/etc/krb5.keytab').

-e "enc:salt..."
     Uses the specified list of enctype-salttype pairs for setting the
     key of the principal.  The quotes are necessary if there are
     multiple enctype-salttype pairs.  This will not function against
     kadmin daemons earlier than krb5-1.2.  See *Note Supported
     Encryption Types:: and *Note Salts:: for all possible values.

-q
     run in quiet mode.  This causes `ktadd' to display less verbose
     information.

principal | -glob principal expression
     add principal, or all principals matching principal expression to
     the keytab.  The rules for principal expression are the same as
     for the kadmin `list_principals' (*note Retrieving a List of
     Principals::) command.

Here is a sample session, using configuration files that enable only
`des-cbc-crc' encryption. (The line beginning with => is a continuation
of the previous line.)

     kadmin: ktadd host/daffodil.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     kadmin: Entry for principal host/daffodil.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 2, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
          WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin:

     kadmin: ktadd -k /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadmind.keytab
     => kadmin/admin kadmin/changepw
     kadmin: Entry for principal kadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab

7.1.2 Removing Principals from Keytabs
--------------------------------------

To remove a principal from an existing keytab, use the kadmin
`ktremove' command.  The syntax is:

     ktremove [-k[eytab] keytab] [-q] principal [kvno | all | old]

The `ktremove' command takes the following switches:

-k[eytab] keytab
     use keytab as the keytab file.  Otherwise, `ktremove' will use the
     default keytab file (`/etc/krb5.keytab').

-q
     run in quiet mode.  This causes `ktremove' to display less verbose
     information.

principal
     the principal to remove from the keytab.  (Required.)

kvno
     remove all entries for the specified principal whose Key Version
     Numbers match kvno.

all
     remove all entries for the specified principal

old
     remove all entries for the specified principal except those with
     the highest kvno.

For example:

     kadmin: ktremove -k /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadmind.keytab kadmin/admin
     kadmin: Entry for principal kadmin/admin with kvno 3 removed
          from keytab WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadmind.keytab.

7.2 Clock Skew
==============

In order to prevent intruders from resetting their system clocks in
order to continue to use expired tickets, Kerberos V5 is set up to
reject ticket requests from any host whose clock is not within the
specified maximum clock skew of the KDC (as specified in the `kdc.conf'
file).  Similarly, hosts are configured to reject responses from any
KDC whose clock is not within the specified maximum clock skew of the
host (as specified in the `krb5.conf' file).  The default value for
maximum clock skew is 300 seconds, or five minutes.

MIT suggests that you add a line to client machines' `/etc/rc' files to
synchronize the machine's clock to your KDC at boot time.  On UNIX
hosts, assuming you had a kdc called `kerberos' in your realm, this
would be:

     gettime -s kerberos

If the host is not likely to be rebooted frequently, you may also want
to set up a cron job that adjusts the time on a regular basis.

7.3 Getting DNS Information Correct
===================================

Several aspects of Kerberos rely on name service.  In order for Kerberos
to provide its high level of security, it is less forgiving of name
service problems than some other parts of your network.  It is important
that your Domain Name System (DNS) entries and your hosts have the
correct information.

Each host's canonical name must be the fully-qualified host name
(including the domain), and each host's IP address must reverse-resolve
to the canonical name.

Other than the `localhost' entry, make all entries in each machine's
`/etc/hosts' file in the following form:

     IP address      fully-qualified hostname        aliases

Here is a sample `/etc/hosts' file:

     # this is a comment
     127.0.0.1       localhost localhost@mit.edu
     10.0.0.6       daffodil.mit.edu trillium wake-robin

Additionally, on Solaris machines, you need to be sure the "hosts"
entry in the file
`/etc/nsswitch.conf' includes the source "dns" as well as "file".

Finally, each host's keytab file must include a host/key pair for the
host's canonical name.  You can list the keys in a keytab file by
issuing the command `klist -k'.  For example:

     viola# klist -k
     Keytab name: /etc/krb5.keytab
     KVNO Principal
     ---- ------------------------------------------------------------
        1 host/daffodil.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

If you telnet to the host with a fresh credentials cache (ticket file),
and then `klist', the host's service principal should be
host/fully-qualified-hostname@REALM_NAME.


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Configuring Your Firewall to Work With Kerberos V5,  Prev: Getting DNS Information Correct,  Up: Application Servers

7.4 Configuring Your Firewall to Work With Kerberos V5
======================================================

If you need off-site users to be able to get Kerberos tickets in your
realm, they must be able to get to your KDC.  This requires either that
you have a slave KDC outside your firewall, or you configure your
firewall to allow UDP requests into at least one of your KDCs, on
whichever port the KDC is running.  (The default is port 88; other
ports may be specified in the KDC's kdc.conf file.)  Similarly, if you
need off-site users to be able to change their passwords in your realm,
they must be able to get to your Kerberos admin server.  The default
port for the admin server is 749.

If your on-site users inside your firewall will need to get to KDCs in
other realms, you will also need to configure your firewall to allow
outgoing TCP and UDP requests to port 88.  Additionally, if they will
need to get to any Kerberos V4 KDCs, you may also need to allow TCP and
UDP requests to port 750.  If your on-site users inside your firewall
will need to get to Kerberos admin servers in other realms, you will
also need to allow outgoing TCP and UDP requests to port
749.

If any of your KDCs are outside your firewall, you will need to allow
`kprop' requests to get through to the remote KDC.  `Kprop' uses the
krb5_prop service on port 754 (tcp).

If you need your off-site users to have access to machines inside your
firewall, you need to allow TCP connections from their off-site hosts on
the appropriate ports for the programs they will be using.  The
following lines from `/etc/services' show the default port numbers for
the Kerberos V5 programs:

     ftp           21/tcp           # Kerberos ftp and telnet use the
     telnet        23/tcp           # default ports
     kerberos      88/udp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC
     kerberos      88/tcp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC
     klogin        543/tcp          # Kerberos authenticated rlogin
     kshell        544/tcp   cmd    # and remote shell
     kerberos-adm  749/tcp          # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw
     kerberos-adm  749/udp          # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw
     krb5_prop     754/tcp          # Kerberos slave propagation
     eklogin       2105/tcp         # Kerberos auth. & encrypted rlogin

By default, Kerberos V5 `telnet' and `ftp' use the same ports as the
standard `telnet' and `ftp' programs, so if you already allow telnet
and ftp connections through your firewall, the Kerberos V5 versions
will get through as well.  If you do not already allow telnet and ftp
connections through your firewall, but need your users to be able to
use Kerberos V5 telnet and ftp, you can either allow ftp and telnet
connections on the standard ports, or switch these programs to
non-default port numbers and allow ftp and telnet connections on those
ports to get through.

Kerberos V5 `rlogin' uses the `klogin' service, which by default uses
port 543.  Encrypted Kerberos V5 rlogin uses the `eklogin' service,
which by default uses port 2105.

Kerberos V5 `rsh' uses the `kshell' service, which by default uses port
544.  However, the server must be able to make a TCP connection from
the kshell port to an arbitrary port on the client, so if your users
are to be able to use `rsh' from outside your firewall, the server they
connect to must be able to send outgoing packets to arbitrary port
numbers.  Similarly, if your users need to run `rsh' from inside your
firewall to hosts outside your firewall, the outside server needs to be
able to connect to an arbitrary port on the machine inside your
firewall.  Because Kerberos V5 `rcp' uses `rsh', the same issues apply.
If you need to use `rsh' (or `rcp') through your firewall and are
concerned with the security implications of allowing connections to
arbitrary ports, MIT suggests that you have rules that specifically
name these applications and, if possible, list the allowed hosts.

The book `UNIX System Security', by David Curry, is a good starting
point for learning to configure firewalls.

8 Backups of Secure Hosts
*************************

When you back up a secure host, you should exclude the host's keytab
file from the backup.  If someone obtained a copy of the keytab from a
backup, that person could make any host masquerade as the host whose
keytab was compromised.  This could be particularly dangerous if the
compromised keytab was from one of your KDCs.  If the machine has a disk
crash and the keytab file is lost, it is easy to generate another keytab
file.  (*Note Adding Principals to Keytabs::.)  If you are unable to
exclude particular files from backups, you should ensure that the
backups are kept as secure as the host's root password.

* Menu:

* Backing Up the Kerberos Database::


File: krb5-admin.info,  Node: Backing Up the Kerberos Database,  Prev: Backups of Secure Hosts,  Up: Backups of Secure Hosts

8.1 Backing Up the Kerberos Database
====================================

As with any file, it is possible that your Kerberos database could
become corrupted.  If this happens on one of the slave KDCs, you might
never notice, since the next automatic propagation of the database would
install a fresh copy.  However, if it happens to the master KDC, the
corrupted database would be propagated to all of the slaves during the
next propagation.  For this reason, MIT recommends that you back up
your Kerberos database regularly.  Because the master KDC is
continuously dumping the database to a file in order to propagate it to
the slave KDCs, it is a simple matter to have a cron job periodically
copy the dump file to a secure machine elsewhere on your network.  (Of
course, it is important to make the host where these backups are stored
as secure as your KDCs, and to encrypt its transmission across your
network.)  Then if your database becomes corrupted, you can load the
most recent dump onto the master KDC.  (*Note Restoring a Kerberos
Database from a Dump File::.)

9 Bug Reporting
***************

In any complex software, there will be bugs.  If you have successfully
built and installed Kerberos V5, please use the `krb5-send-pr' program
to fill out a Problem Report should you encounter any errors in our
software.

Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
do include fixes, please send them using either context diffs or unified
diffs (using `diff -c' or `diff -u', respectively).  Please be careful
when using "cut and paste" or other such means to copy a patch into a
bug report; depending on the system being used, that can result in
converting TAB characters into spaces, which makes applying the patches
more difficult.

The `krb5-send-pr' program is installed in the directory
`/usr/local/sbin'.

The `krb5-send-pr' program enters the problem report into our Problem
Report Management System (PRMS), which automatically assigns it to the
engineer best able to help you with problems in the assigned category.

The `krb5-send-pr' program will try to intelligently fill in as many
fields as it can.  You need to choose the "category", "class",
"severity", and "priority" of the problem, as well as giving us as much
information as you can about its exact nature.

The PR category will be one of:

     krb5-admin   krb5-appl    krb5-build   krb5-clients
     krb5-doc     krb5-kdc     krb5-libs    krb5-misc
     pty          telnet       test

Choose the category that best describes the area under which your
problem falls.

The class can be "sw-bug", "doc-bug", "change-request", or "support".
The first two are exactly as their names imply.  Use change-request
when the software is behaving according to specifications, but you want
to request changes in some feature or behavior.  The support class is
intended for more general questions about building or using Kerberos V5.

The severity of the problem indicates the problem's impact on the
usability of Kerberos V5.  If a problem is "critical", that means the
product, component or concept is completely non-operational, or some
essential functionality is missing, and no workaround is known.  A
"serious" problem is one in which the product, component or concept is
not working properly or significant functionality is missing.  Problems
that would otherwise be considered critical are rated serious when a
workaround is known.  A "non-critical" problem is one that is indeed a
problem, but one that is having a minimal effect on your ability to use
Kerberos V5.  E.g., The product, component or concept is working in
general, but lacks features, has irritating behavior, does something
wrong, or doesn't match its documentation.  The default severity is
serious.

The priority indicates how urgent this particular problem is in
relation to your work.  Note that low priority does not imply low
importance.  A priority of "high" means a solution is needed as soon as
possible.  A priority of "medium" means the problem should be solved no
later than the next release.  A priority of "low" means the problem
should be solved in a future release, but it is not important to your
work how soon this happens.  The default priority is medium.

Note that a given severity does not necessarily imply a given priority.
For example, a non-critical problem might still have a high priority if
you are faced with a hard deadline.  Conversely, a serious problem might
have a low priority if the feature it is disabling is one that you do
not need.

It is important that you fill in the release field and tell us what
changes you have made, if any.
