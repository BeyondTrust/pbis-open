1.1 What is Kerberos and How Does it Work?
==========================================

Kerberos V5 is based on the Kerberos authentication system developed at
MIT.  Under Kerberos, a client (generally either a user or a service)
sends a request for a ticket to the Key Distribution Center (KDC).  The
KDC creates a "ticket-granting ticket" (TGT) for the client, encrypts
it using the client's password as the key, and sends the encrypted TGT
back to the client.  The client then attempts to decrypt the TGT, using
its password.  If the client successfully decrypts the TGT (i.e., if
the client gave the correct password), it keeps the decrypted TGT,
which indicates proof of the client's identity.

The TGT, which expires at a specified time, permits the client to obtain
additional tickets, which give permission for specific services.  The
requesting and granting of these additional tickets is user-transparent.

1.2 Why Should I use Kerberos?
==============================

Since Kerberos negotiates authenticated, and optionally encrypted,
communications between two points anywhere on the Internet, it provides
a layer of security that is not dependent on which side of a firewall
either client is on.  Since studies have shown that half of the computer
security breaches in industry happen from inside firewalls, Kerberos V5
from MIT will play a vital role in the security of your network.

1.3 Please Read the Documentation
=================================

As with any software package that uses a centrallized database, the
installation procedure is somewhat involved, and requires forethought
and planning.  MIT has attempted to make this Kerberos V5 Installation
Guide as concise as possible, rather than making it an exhaustive
description of the details of Kerberos.  Consequently, everything in
this guide appears because MIT believes that it is important.  Please
read and follow these instructions carefully.

This document is one piece of the document set for Kerberos V5.  The
documents, and their intended audiences, are:

   * Kerberos V5 Installation Guide:  a concise guide for installing
     Kerberos V5.  Kerberos administrators (particularly whoever will be
     making site-wide decisions about the installation) and the system
     administrators who will be installing the software should read this
     guide.

   * Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide:  a sysadmin's guide to
     administering a Kerberos installation.  The System Administrator's
     Guide describes the administration software and suggests policies
     and procedures for administering a Kerberos installation.  Anyone
     who will have administrative access to your Kerberos database
     should read this guide.

   * Kerberos V5 UNIX User's Guide:  a guide to using the Kerberos UNIX
     client programs.  All users on UNIX systems should read this guide,
     particularly the "Tutorial" section.

       A. The Master KDC.

       B. Slave KDCs.

  2. UNIX client machines

  3. UNIX application server machines

Note that a machine can be both a client machine and an application
server.

2 Realm Configuration Decisions
*******************************

Before installing Kerberos V5, it is necessary to consider the
following issues:

   * The name of your Kerberos realm (or the name of each realm, if you
     need more than one).

   * How you will map your hostnames onto Kerberos realms.

   * Which ports your KDC and and kadmin (database access) services
     will use.

   * How many slave KDCs you need and where they should be located.

   * The hostnames of your master and slave KDCs.

   * How frequently you will propagate the database from the master KDC
     to the slave KDCs.

* Menu:

* Kerberos Realms::
* Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms::
* Ports for the KDC and Admin Services::
* Slave KDCs::
* Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs::
* Database Propagation::


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Kerberos Realms,  Next: Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms,  Prev: Realm Configuration Decisions,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

2.1 Kerberos Realms
===================

Although your Kerberos realm can be any ASCII string, convention is to
make it the same as your domain name, in upper-case letters.  For
example, hosts in the domain example.com would be in the Kerberos realm
EXAMPLE.COM.

If you need multiple Kerberos realms, MIT recommends that you use
descriptive names which end with your domain name, such as
BOSTON.EXAMPLE.COM and HOUSTON.EXAMPLE.COM.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms,  Next: Ports for the KDC and Admin Services,  Prev: Kerberos Realms,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

2.2 Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms
==========================================

Mapping hostnames onto Kerberos realms is done in one of two ways.

The first mechanism, which has been in use for years in MIT-based
Kerberos distributions, works through a set of rules in the `krb5.conf'
configuration file.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)  You can specify mappings for
an entire domain or subdomain, and/or on a hostname-by-hostname basis.
Since greater specificity takes precedence, you would do this by
specifying the mappings for a given domain or subdomain and listing the
exceptions.

The second mechanism works by looking up the information in special
`TXT' records in the Domain Name Service.  This is currently not used
by default because security holes could result if the DNS TXT records
were spoofed.  If this mechanism is enabled on the client, it will try
to look up a `TXT' record for the DNS name formed by putting the prefix
`_kerberos' in front of the hostname in question.  If that record is
not found, it will try using `_kerberos' and the host's domain name,
then its parent domain, and so forth.  So for the hostname
BOSTON.ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM, the names looked up would be:

     _kerberos.boston.engineering.foobar.com
     _kerberos.engineering.foobar.com
     _kerberos.foobar.com
     _kerberos.com

The value of the first TXT record found is taken as the realm name.
(Obviously, this doesn't work all that well if a host and a subdomain
have the same name, and different realms.  For example, if all the hosts
in the ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM domain are in the ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM
realm, but a host named ENGINEERING.FOOBAR.COM is for some reason in
another realm.  In that case, you would set up TXT records for all
hosts, rather than relying on the fallback to the domain name.)

Even if you do not choose to use this mechanism within your site, you
may wish to set it up anyway, for use when interacting with other sites.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Ports for the KDC and Admin Services,  Next: Slave KDCs,  Prev: Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

2.3 Ports for the KDC and Admin Services
========================================

The default ports used by Kerberos are port 88 for the KDC(1)  and port
749 for the admin server.  You can, however, choose to run on other
ports, as long as they are specified in each host's `/etc/services' and
`krb5.conf' files, and the `kdc.conf' file on each KDC.  For a more
thorough treatment of port numbers used by the Kerberos V5 programs,
refer to the "Configuring Your Firewall to Work With Kerberos V5"
section of the `Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide'.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) Kerberos V4 used port 750.  If necessary, you can run on both ports
for backward compatibility.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Slave KDCs,  Next: Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs,  Prev: Ports for the KDC and Admin Services,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

2.4 Slave KDCs
==============

Slave KDCs provide an additional source of Kerberos ticket-granting
services in the event of inaccessibility of the master KDC.  The number
of slave KDCs you need and the decision of where to place them, both
physically and logically, depends on the specifics of your network.

All of the Kerberos authentication on your network requires that each
client be able to contact a KDC.  Therefore, you need to anticipate any
likely reason a KDC might be unavailable and have a slave KDC to take up
the slack.

Some considerations include:

   * Have at least one slave KDC as a backup, for when the master KDC is
     down, is being upgraded, or is otherwise unavailable.

   * If your network is split such that a network outage is likely to
     cause a network partition (some segment or segments of the network
     to become cut off or isolated from other segments), have a slave
     KDC accessible to each segment.

   * If possible, have at least one slave KDC in a different building
     from the master, in case of power outages, fires, or other
     localized disasters.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs,  Next: Database Propagation,  Prev: Slave KDCs,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

2.5 Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs
===========================================

MIT recommends that your KDCs have a predefined set of CNAME records
(DNS hostname aliases), such as `kerberos' for the master KDC and
`kerberos-1', `kerberos-2', ... for the slave KDCs.  This way, if you
need to swap a machine, you only need to change a DNS entry, rather
than having to change hostnames.

A new mechanism for locating KDCs of a realm through DNS has been added
to the MIT Kerberos V5 distribution.  A relatively new record type
called `SRV' has been added to DNS.  Looked up by a service name and a
domain name, these records indicate the hostname and port number to
contact for that service, optionally with weighting and prioritization.
(See RFC 2782 if you want more information.  You can follow the
example below for straightforward cases.)

The use with Kerberos is fairly straightforward.  The domain name used
in the SRV record name is the domain-style Kerberos realm name.  (It is
possible to have Kerberos realm names that are not DNS-style names, but
we don't recommend it for Internet use, and our code does not support it
well.)  Several different Kerberos-related service names are used:

`_kerberos._udp'
     This is for contacting any KDC by UDP.  This entry will be used
     the most often.  Normally you should list port 88 on each of your
     KDCs.

`_kerberos._tcp'
     This is for contacting any KDC by TCP.  The MIT KDC by default
     will not listen on any TCP ports, so unless you've changed the
     configuration or you're running another KDC implementation, you
     should leave this unspecified.  If you do enable TCP support,
     normally you should use port 88.

`_kerberos-master._udp'
     This entry should refer to those KDCs, if any, that will
     immediately see password changes to the Kerberos database.  This
     entry is used only in one case, when the user is logging in and
     the password appears to be incorrect; the master KDC is then
     contacted, and the same password used to try to decrypt the
     response, in case the user's password had recently been changed
     and the first KDC contacted hadn't been updated.  Only if that
     fails is an "incorrect password" error given.

     If you have only one KDC, or for whatever reason there is no
     accessible KDC that would get database changes faster than the
     others, you do not need to define this entry.

`_kerberos-adm._tcp'
     This should list port 749 on your master KDC.  Support for it is
     not complete at this time, but it will eventually be used by the
     `kadmin' program and related utilities.  For now, you will also
     need the `admin_server' entry in `krb5.conf'.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)

`_kpasswd._udp'
     This should list port 464 on your master KDC.  It is used when a
     user changes her password.


Be aware, however, that the DNS SRV specification requires that the
hostnames listed be the canonical names, not aliases.  So, for example,
you might include the following records in your (BIND-style) zone file:

     $ORIGIN foobar.com.
     _kerberos               TXT       "FOOBAR.COM"
     kerberos                CNAME     daisy
     kerberos-1              CNAME     use-the-force-luke
     kerberos-2              CNAME     bunny-rabbit
     _kerberos._udp          SRV       0 0 88 daisy
                             SRV       0 0 88 use-the-force-luke
                             SRV       0 0 88 bunny-rabbit
     _kerberos-master._udp   SRV       0 0 88 daisy
     _kerberos-adm._tcp      SRV       0 0 749 daisy
     _kpasswd._udp           SRV       0 0 464 daisy

As with the DNS-based mechanism for determining the Kerberos realm of a
host, we recommend distributing the information this way for use by
other sites that may want to interact with yours using Kerberos, even if
you don't immediately make use of it within your own site.  If you
anticipate installing a very large number of machines on which it will
be hard to update the Kerberos configuration files, you may wish to do
all of your Kerberos service lookups via DNS and not put the information
(except for `admin_server' as noted above) in future versions of your
`krb5.conf' files at all.  Eventually, we hope to phase out the listing
of server hostnames in the client-side configuration files; making
preparations now will make the transition easier in the future.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Database Propagation,  Prev: Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs,  Up: Realm Configuration Decisions

2.6 Database Propagation
========================

The Kerberos database resides on the master KDC, and must be propagated
regularly (usually by a cron job) to the slave KDCs.  In deciding how
frequently the propagation should happen, you will need to balance the
amount of time the propagation takes against the maximum reasonable
amount of time a user should have to wait for a password change to take
effect.

If the propagation time is longer than this maximum reasonable time
(e.g., you have a particularly large database, you have a lot of
slaves, or you experience frequent network delays), you may wish to cut
down on your propagation delay by performing the propagation in
parallel.  To do this, have the master KDC propagate the database to one
set of slaves, and then have each of these slaves propagate the database
to additional slaves.

3.1.1 The appl Directory
------------------------

The Kerberos release provides certain UNIX utilities, modified to use
Kerberos authentication.  In the appl/bsd directory are the Berkeley
utilities login, rlogin, rsh, and rcp, as well as the associated
daemons kshd and klogind.  The login program obtains ticket-granting
tickets for users upon login; the other utilities provide authenticated
Unix network services.

The appl directory also contains Kerberized telnet and ftp programs, as
well as sample Kerberos application client and server programs.

3.1.2 The clients Directory
---------------------------

This directory contains the code for several user-oriented programs.

kdestroy
     This program destroys the user's active Kerberos authorization
     tickets.  MIT recommends that users `kdestroy' before logging out.

kinit
     This program prompts users for their Kerberos principal name and
     password, and attempts to get an initial ticket-granting-ticket
     for that principal.

klist
     This program lists the Kerberos principal and Kerberos tickets
     held in a credentials cache, or the keys held in a keytab file.

kpasswd
     This program changes a user's Kerberos password.

ksu
     This program is a Kerberized version of the `su' program that is
     meant to securely change the real and effective user ID to that of
     the target user and to create a new security context.

kvno
     This program acquires a service ticket for the specified Kerberos
     principals and prints out the key version numbers of each.

3.1.5 The kadmin Directory
--------------------------

In this directory is the code for the utilities `kadmin',
`kadmin.local', `kdb5_util', and `ktutil'.  `ktutil' is the Kerberos
keytab file maintenance utility from which a Kerberos administrator can
read, write, or edit entries in a Kerberos V5 keytab or Kerberos V4
srvtab.  `kadmin' and `kadmin.local' are command-line interfaces to the
Kerberos V5 KADM5 administration system.  `kadmin.local' runs on the
master KDC and does not use Kerberos to authenticate to the database,
while `kadmin' uses Kerberos authentication and an encrypted RPC.  The
two provide identical functionalities, which allow administrators to
modify the database of Kerberos principals.  `kdb5_util' allows
administrators to perform low-level maintenance procedures on Kerberos
and the KADM5 database.  With this utility, databases can be created,
destroyed, or dumped to and loaded from ASCII files.  It can also be
used to create master key stash files.

3.1.8 The lib Directory
-----------------------

The lib directory contain 10 subdirectories as well as some definition
and glue files.  The crypto subdirectory contains the Kerberos V5
encryption library.  The des425 subdirectory exports the Kerberos V4
encryption API, and translates these functions into calls to the
Kerberos V5 encryption API.  The gssapi library contains the Generic
Security Services API, which is a library of commands to be used in
secure client-server communication.  The kadm5 directory contains the
libraries for the KADM5 administration utilities.  The Kerberos 5
database libraries are contained in kdb.  The directories krb4 and krb5
contain the Kerberos 4 and Kerberos 5 APIs, respectively.  The rpc
directory contains the API for the Kerberos Remote Procedure Call
protocol.

3.1.9 The prototype Directory
-----------------------------

This directory contains several template files.  The `prototype.h' and
`prototype.c' files contain the MIT copyright message and a placeholder
for the title and description of the file.  `prototype.h' also has a
short template for writing `ifdef' and `ifndef' preprocessor
statements.  The `getopt.c' file provides a template for writing code
that will parse the options with which a program was called.

3.1.10 The slave Directory
--------------------------

This directory contains code which allows for the propagation of the
Kerberos principal database from the master KDC to slave KDCs over an
encrypted, secure channel.  `kprop' is the program which actually
propagates the database dump file.  `kpropd' is the Kerberos V5 slave
KDC update server which accepts connections from the `kprop' program.
`kslave_update' is a script that takes the name of a slave server, and
propagates the database to that server if the database has been
modified since the last dump or if the database has been dumped since
the last propagation.

-------------------------

This directory contains several utility programs and libraries.  The
programs used to configure and build the code, such as `autoconf',
`lndir', `kbuild', `reconf',  and `makedepend', are in this directory.
The profile directory contains most of the functions which parse the
Kerberos configuration files (`krb5.conf' and `kdc.conf').  Also in
this directory are the Kerberos error table library and utilities (et),
the Sub-system library and utilities (ss), database utilities (db2),
pseudo-terminal utilities (pty), bug-reporting program `send-pr', and a
generic support library `support' used by several of our other
libraries.

3.2 Build Requirements
======================

In order to build Kerberos V5, you will need approximately 60-70
megabytes of disk space.  The exact amount will vary depending on the
platform and whether the distribution is compiled with debugging symbol
tables or not.

Your C compiler must conform to ANSI C (ISO/IEC 9899:1990, "c89").
Some operating systems do not have an ANSI C compiler, or their default
compiler requires extra command-line options to enable ANSI C
conformance.

If you wish to keep a separate "build tree", which contains the compiled
`*.o' file and executables, separate from your source tree, you will
need a `make' program which supports `VPATH', or you will need to use a
tool such as `lndir' to produce a symbolic link tree for your build
tree.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Unpacking the Sources,  Next: Doing the Build,  Prev: Build Requirements,  Up: Building Kerberos V5

3.3 Unpacking the Sources
=========================

The first step in each of these build procedures is to unpack the
source distribution.  The Kerberos V5 distribution comes in a tar file,
generally named `krb5-1.7.tar', which contains a compressed tar file
consisting of the sources for all of Kerberos (generally
`krb5-1.7.tar.gz') and a PGP signature for this source tree (generally
`krb5-1.7.tar.gz.asc').  MIT highly recommends that you verify the
integrity of the source code using this signature.

Unpack the compressed tar file in some directory, such as
`/u1/krb5-1.7'.  (In the rest of this document, we will assume that you
have chosen to unpack the Kerberos V5 source distribution in this
directory.  Note that the tarfiles will by default all unpack into the
`./krb5-1.7' directory, so that if your current directory is `/u1' when
you unpack the tarfiles, you will get `/u1/krb5-1.7/src', etc.)

3.4 Doing the Build
===================

You have a number of different options in how to build Kerberos.  If you
only need to build Kerberos for one platform, using a single directory
tree which contains both the source files and the object files is the
simplest.  However, if you need to maintain Kerberos for a large number
of platforms, you will probably want to use separate build trees for
each platform. We recommend that you look at *Note OS
Incompatibilities::, for notes that we have on particular operating
systems.

If you don't want separate build trees for each architecture, then use
the following abbreviated procedure.

  1.  `cd /u1/krb5-1.7/src'

  2.  `./configure'

  3.  `make'

That's it!

3.4.2 Building with Separate Build Directories
----------------------------------------------

If you wish to keep separate build directories for each platform, you
can do so using the following procedure.  (Note, this requires that your
`make' program support `VPATH'.  GNU's make will provide this
functionality, for example.)  If your `make' program does not support
this, see the next section.

For example, if you wish to create a build directory for `pmax' binaries
you might use the following procedure:

  1. `mkdir /u1/krb5-1.7/pmax'

  2.  `cd /u1/krb5-1.7/pmax'

  3.  `../src/configure'

  4.  `make'


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Building using lndir,  Prev: Building with Separate Build Directories,  Up: Doing the Build

3.4.3 Building Using `lndir'
----------------------------

If you wish to keep separate build directories for each platform, and
you do not have access to a `make' program which supports `VPATH', all
is not lost.  You can use the `lndir' program to create symbolic link
trees in your build directory.

For example, if you wish to create a build directory for solaris
binaries you might use the following procedure:

  1.  `mkdir /u1/krb5-1.7/solaris'

  2.  `cd /u1/krb5-1.7/solaris'

  3.  `/u1/krb5-1.7/src/util/lndir `pwd`/../src'

  4.  `./configure'

  5.  `make'

You must give an absolute pathname to `lndir' because it has a bug that
makes it fail for relative pathnames. Note that this version differs
from the latest version as distributed and installed by the XConsortium
with X11R6. Either version should be acceptable.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Installing the Binaries,  Next: Testing the Build,  Prev: Doing the Build,  Up: Building Kerberos V5

3.5 Installing the Binaries
===========================

Once you have built Kerberos, you should install the binaries.  You can
do this by running:

     % make install

If you want to install the binaries into a destination directory that
is not their final destination, which may be convenient if you want to
build a binary distribution to be deployed on multiple hosts, you may
use:

     % make install DESTDIR=/path/to/destdir

This will install the binaries under `DESTDIR/PREFIX', e.g., the user
programs will install into `DESTDIR/PREFIX/bin', the libraries into
`DESTDIR/PREFIX/lib', etc.

Note that if you want to test the build (see *Note Testing the Build::),
you usually do not need to do a `make install' first.

Some implementations of `make' allow multiple commands to be run in
parallel, for faster builds.  We test our Makefiles in parallel builds
with GNU `make' only; they may not be compatible with other parallel
build implementations.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Testing the Build,  Next: Options to Configure,  Prev: Installing the Binaries,  Up: Building Kerberos V5

3.6 Testing the Build
=====================

The Kerberos V5 distribution comes with built-in regression tests.  To
run them, simply type the following command while in the top-level build
directory (i.e., the directory where you sent typed `make' to start
building Kerberos; see *Note Doing the Build::.):

     % make check

However, there are several prerequisites that must be satisfied first:

   * Configure and build Kerberos with Tcl support.  Tcl is used to
     drive the test suite.  This often means passing `--with-tcl' to
     configure to tell it the location of the Tcl configuration script.
     (See *Note Options to Configure::.)

   * You have to run `make install' before running `make check', or the
     test suite will often pick up the installed version of Kerberos
     rather than the newly built one.  You can install into a prefix
     that isn't in the system library search path, though.  This
     theoretically could be fixed with the appropriate environment
     variable magic in the test suite, but hasn't been yet.

   * In order to test the RPC layer, the local system has to be running
     the `portmap' daemon and it has to be listening to the regular
     network interface (not just localhost).

* Menu:

* The DejaGnu Tests::
* The KADM5 Tests::


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The DejaGnu Tests,  Next: The KADM5 Tests,  Prev: Testing the Build,  Up: Testing the Build

3.6.1 The DejaGnu Tests
-----------------------

Some of the built-in regression tests are setup to use the DejaGnu
framework for running tests. These tests tend to be more comprehensive
than the normal built-in tests as they setup test servers and test
client/server activities.

DejaGnu may be found wherever GNU software is archived.

Most of the tests are setup to run as a non-privileged user.  For some
of the krb-root tests to work properly, either (a) the user running the
tests must not have a .k5login file in the home directory or (b) the
.k5login file must contain an entry for `<username>@KRBTEST.COM'.
There are two series of tests (`rlogind' and `telnetd') which require
the ability to `rlogin' as root to the local machine. Admittedly, this
does require the use of a `.rhosts' file or some authenticated means.
(1)

If you cannot obtain root access to your machine, all the other tests
will still run. Note however, with DejaGnu 1.2, the "untested testcases"
will cause the testsuite to exit with a non-zero exit status which
`make' will consider a failure of the testing process. Do not worry
about this, as these tests are the last run when `make check' is
executed from the top level of the build tree.  This problem does not
exist with DejaGnu 1.3.

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) If you are fortunate enough to have a previous version of Kerberos
V5 or V4 installed, and the Kerberos rlogin is first in your path, you
can setup `.k5login' or `.klogin' respectively to allow you access.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: The KADM5 Tests,  Prev: The DejaGnu Tests,  Up: Testing the Build

3.6.2 The KADM5 Tests
---------------------

Regression tests for the KADM5 system, including the GSS-RPC, KADM5
client and server libraries, and kpasswd, are also included in this
release.  Each set of KADM5 tests is contained in a sub-directory called
`unit-test' directly below the system being tested.  For example,
lib/rpc/unit-test contains the tests for GSS-RPC.  The tests are all
based on DejaGnu (but they are not actually called part of "The DejaGnu
tests," whose naming predates the inclusion of the KADM5 system).  In
addition, they require the Tool Command Language (TCL) header files and
libraries to be available during compilation and some of the tests also
require Perl in order to operate.  If all of these resources are not
available during configuration, the KADM5 tests will not run.  The TCL
installation directory can be specified with the `--with-tcl' configure
option.  (See *Note Options to Configure::.)  The runtest and perl
programs must be in the current execution path.

If you install DejaGnu, TCL, or Perl after configuring and building
Kerberos and then want to run the KADM5 tests, you will need to
re-configure the tree and run `make' at the top level again to make
sure all the proper programs are built.  To save time, you actually only
need to reconfigure and build in the directories src/kadmin/testing,
src/lib/rpc, src/lib/kadm5.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Options to Configure,  Next: osconf.h,  Prev: Testing the Build,  Up: Building Kerberos V5

3.7 Options to Configure
========================

There are a number of options to `configure' which you can use to
control how the Kerberos distribution is built.  The following table
lists the most commonly used options to Kerberos V5's `configure'
program.

`--help'
     Provides help to configure. This will list the set of commonly used
     options for building Kerberos.

`--prefix=PREFIX'
     By default, Kerberos will install the package's files rooted at
     `/usr/local' as in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/sbin', etc. If you
     desire a different location, use this option.

`--exec-prefix=EXECPREFIX'
     This option allows one to separate the architecture independent
     programs from the configuration files and manual pages.

`--localstatedir=LOCALSTATEDIR'
     This option sets the directory for locally modifiable
     single-machine data.  In Kerberos, this mostly is useful for
     setting a location for the KDC data files, as they will be
     installed in `LOCALSTATEDIR/krb5kdc', which is by default
     `PREFIX/var/krb5kdc'.

`CC=COMPILER'
     Use `COMPILER' as the C compiler.

`CFLAGS=FLAGS'
     Use `FLAGS' as the default set of C compiler flags.

     Note that if you use the native Ultrix compiler on a DECstation
     you are likely to lose if you pass no flags to cc; md4.c takes an
     estimated 3,469 billion years to compile if you provide neither
     the `-g' flag nor the `-O' flag to `cc'.

`CPPFLAGS=CPPOPTS'
     Use `CPPOPTS' as the default set of C preprocessor flags.  The most
     common use of this option is to select certain `#define''s for use
     with the operating system's include files.

`LD=LINKER'
     Use `LINKER' as the default loader if it should be different from C
     compiler as specified above.

`LDFLAGS=LDOPTS'
     This option allows one to specify optional arguments to be passed
     to the linker. This might be used to specify optional library
     paths.

`--with-krb4'
     This option enables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility using the
     builtin Kerberos V4 library.

`--with-krb4=KRB4DIR'
     This option enables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility using a
     pre-existing Kerberos V4 installation.  The directory specified by
     `KRB4DIR' specifies where the V4 header files should be found
     (`KRB4DIR/include') as well as where the V4 Kerberos library should
     be found (`KRB4DIR/lib').

`--without-krb4'
     Disables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility. This prevents
     Kerberos V4 clients from using the V5 services including the KDC.
     This would be useful if you know you will never install or need to
     interact with V4 clients.

`--with-netlib[=libs]'
     Allows for suppression of or replacement of network libraries. By
     default, Kerberos V5 configuration will look for `-lnsl' and
     `-lsocket'. If your operating system has a broken resolver library
     (see *Note Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3::) or fails to pass
     the tests in `src/tests/resolv' you will need to use this option.

`--with-tcl=TCLPATH'
     Some of the unit-tests in the build tree rely upon using a program
     in Tcl. The directory specified by `TCLPATH' specifies where the
     Tcl header file (`TCLPATH/include/tcl.h' as well as where the Tcl
     library should be found (`TCLPATH/lib').

`--enable-shared'
     This option will turn on the building and use of shared library
     objects in the Kerberos build. This option is only supported on
     certain platforms.

`--enable-dns'

`--enable-dns-for-kdc'

`--enable-dns-for-realm'
     Enable the use of DNS to look up a host's Kerberos realm, or a
     realm's KDCs, if the information is not provided in krb5.conf. See
     *Note Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs:: for information
     about using DNS to locate the KDCs, and *Note Mapping Hostnames
     onto Kerberos Realms:: for information about using DNS to
     determine the default realm.  By default, DNS lookups are enabled
     for the former but not for the latter.

`--enable-kdc-replay-cache'
     Enable a cache in the KDC to detect retransmitted messages, and
     resend the previous responses to them.  This protects against
     certain types of attempts to extract information from the KDC
     through some of the hardware preauthentication systems.

`--with-system-et'
     Use an installed version of the error-table support software, the
     `compile_et' program, the `com_err.h' header file and the
     `com_err' library.  If these are not in the default locations, you
     may wish to specify `CPPFLAGS=-I/some/dir' and
     `LDFLAGS=-L/some/other/dir' options at configuration time as well.

     If this option is not given, a version supplied with the Kerberos
     sources will be built and installed along with the rest of the
     Kerberos tree, for Kerberos applications to link against.

`--with-system-ss'
     Use an installed version of the subsystem command-line interface
     software, the `mk_cmds' program, the `ss/ss.h' header file and the
     `ss' library.  If these are not in the default locations, you may
     wish to specify `CPPFLAGS=-I/some/dir' and
     `LDFLAGS=-L/some/other/dir' options at configuration time as well.
     See also the `SS_LIB' option.

     If this option is not given, the `ss' library supplied with the
     Kerberos sources will be compiled and linked into those programs
     that need it; it will not be installed separately.

`SS_LIB=libs...'
     If `-lss' is not the correct way to link in your installed `ss'
     library, for example if additional support libraries are needed,
     specify the correct link options here.  Some variants of this
     library are around which allow for Emacs-like line editing, but
     different versions require different support libraries to be
     explicitly specified.

     This option is ignored if `--with-system-ss' is not specified.

`--with-system-db'
     Use an installed version of the Berkeley DB package, which must
     provide an API compatible with version 1.85.  This option is
     _unsupported_ and untested.  In particular, we do not know if the
     database-rename code used in the dumpfile load operation will
     behave properly.

     If this option is not given, a version supplied with the Kerberos
     sources will be built and installed.  (We are not updating this
     version at this time because of licensing issues with newer
     versions that we haven't investigated sufficiently yet.)

`DB_HEADER=headername.h'
     If `db.h' is not the correct header file to include to compile
     against the Berkeley DB 1.85 API, specify the correct header file
     name with this option.  For example, `DB_HEADER=db3/db_185.h'.

`DB_LIB=libs...'
     If `-ldb' is not the correct library specification for the
     Berkeley DB library version to be used, override it with this
     option.  For example, `DB_LIB=-ldb-3.3'.


For example, in order to configure Kerberos on a Solaris machine using
the `suncc' compiler with the optimizer turned on, run the configure
script with the following options:

     % ./configure CC=suncc CFLAGS=-O

For a slightly more complicated example, consider a system where
several packages to be used by Kerberos are installed in `/usr/foobar',
including Berkeley DB 3.3, and an `ss' library that needs to link
against the `curses' library.  The configuration of Kerberos might be
done thus:

     % ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/foobar/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/foobar/lib \
                   --with-system-et --with-system-ss --with-system-db \
                   SS_LIB='-lss -lcurses' \
                   DB_HEADER=db3/db_185.h DB_LIB=-ldb-3.3

In previous releases, `--with-' options were used to specify the
compiler and linker and their options.

3.8 `osconf.h'
==============

There is one configuration file which you may wish to edit to control
various compile-time parameters in the Kerberos distribution:
`include/stock/osconf.h'. The list that follows is by no means
complete, just some of the more interesting variables.

Please note: The former configuration file `config.h' no longer exists
as its functionality has been merged into the auto-configuration
process. *Note Options to Configure::.

`DEFAULT_PROFILE_PATH'
     The pathname to the file which contains the profiles for the known
     realms, their KDCs, etc.  The default value is
     /etc/krb5.conf.

     The profile file format is no longer the same format as Kerberos
     V4's `krb.conf' file.

`DEFAULT_KEYTAB_NAME'
     The type and pathname to the default server keytab file (the
     equivalent of Kerberos V4's `/etc/srvtab').  The default is
     /etc/krb5.keytab.

`DEFAULT_KDC_ENCTYPE'
     The default encryption type for the KDC.  The default value is
     des3-cbc-sha1.

`KDCRCACHE'
     The name of the replay cache used by the KDC.  The default value is
     krb5kdc_rcache.

`RCTMPDIR'
     The directory which stores replay caches.  The default is to try
     /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /var/usr/tmp, and /tmp.

`DEFAULT_KDB_FILE'
     The location of the default database.  The default value is
     /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal.



File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Shared Library Support,  Next: OS Incompatibilities,  Prev: osconf.h,  Up: Building Kerberos V5

3.9 Shared Library Support
==========================

Shared library support is provided for a few operating systems. There
are restrictions as to which compiler to use when using shared
libraries. In all cases, executables linked with the shared libraries in
this build process will have built in the location of the libraries,
therefore obliterating the need for special LD_LIBRARY_PATH, et al
environment variables when using the programs. Except where noted,
multiple versions of the libraries may be installed on the same system
and continue to work.

Currently the supported platforms are Solaris 2.6-2.9 (aka SunOS
5.6-5.9), Irix 6.5, Redhat Linux, MacOS 8-10, and Microsoft Windows
(using DLLs).

Shared library support has been tested on the following platforms but
not exhaustively (they have been built but not necessarily tested in an
installed state): Tru64 (aka Alpha OSF/1 or Digital Unix) 4.0, and
HP/UX 10.20.

Platforms for which there is shared library support but not significant
testing include FreeBSD, OpenBSD, AIX (4.3.3), Linux, NetBSD 1.4.x
(i386).

To enable shared libraries on the above platforms, run the configure
script with the option `--enable-shared'.

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: AIX,  Next: Alpha OSF/1 V1.3,  Prev: OS Incompatibilities,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.1 AIX
----------

The AIX 3.2.5 linker dumps core trying to build a shared `libkrb5.a'
produced with the GNU C compiler.  The native AIX compiler works fine.
This problem is fixed using the AIX 4.1 linker.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Alpha OSF/1 V1.3,  Next: Alpha OSF/1 V2.0,  Prev: AIX,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.2 Alpha OSF/1 V1.3
-----------------------

Using the native compiler, compiling with the `-O' compiler flag causes
the `asn.1' library to be compiled incorrectly.

Using GCC version 2.6.3 or later instead of the native compiler will
also work fine, both with or without optimization.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Alpha OSF/1 V2.0,  Next: Alpha OSF/1 V4.0,  Prev: Alpha OSF/1 V1.3,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.3 Alpha OSF/1 V2.0
-----------------------

There used to be a bug when using the native compiler in compiling
`md4.c' when compiled without either the `-O' or `-g' compiler options.
We have changed the code and there is no problem under V2.1, but we do
not have access to V2.0 to test and see if the problem would exist
there. (We welcome feedback on this issue). There was never a problem
in using GCC version 2.6.3.

In version 3.2 and beyond of the operating system, we have not seen
this sort of problem with the native compiler.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Alpha OSF/1 V4.0,  Next: BSDI,  Prev: Alpha OSF/1 V2.0,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.4 Alpha OSF/1 (Digital UNIX) V4.0
--------------------------------------

The C compiler provided with Alpha OSF/1 V4.0 (a.k.a. Digital UNIX)
defaults to an extended K&R C mode, not ANSI C.  You need to provide
the `-std' argument to the compiler (i.e., `./configure CC='cc -std'')
to enable extended ANSI C mode.  More recent versions of the operating
system, such as 5.0, seem to have C compilers which default to `-std'.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: BSDI,  Next: HPUX,  Prev: Alpha OSF/1 V4.0,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.5 BSDI
-----------

BSDI versions 1.0 and 1.1 reportedly has a bad `sed' which causes it to
go into an infinite loop during the build.  The work around is to use a
`sed' from somewhere else, such as GNU.  (This may be true for some
versions of other systems derived from BSD 4.4, such as NetBSD and
FreeBSD.)


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: HPUX,  Next: Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3,  Prev: BSDI,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.6 HPUX
-----------

The native (bundled) compiler for HPUX currently will not work, because
it is not a full ANSI C compiler.  The optional ANSI C compiler should
work as long as you give it the `-Ae' flag (i.e. `./configure CC='cc
-Ae'').  This is equivalent to `./configure CC='c89 -D_HPUX_SOURCE'',
which was the previous recommendation.  This has only been tested
recently for HPUX 10.20.

You will need to configure with `--disable-shared --enable-static',
because as of 1.4 we don't have support for HPUX shared library
finalization routines, nor the option (yet) to ignore that lack of
support (which means repeated `dlopen'/`dlclose' cycles on the Kerberos
libraries may not be safe) and build the shared libraries anyways.

You will also need to configure the build tree with
`--disable-thread-support' if you are on HPUX 10 and do not have the
DCE development package installed, because that's where the `pthread.h'
header file is found.  (We don't know if our code will work with such a
package installed, because according to some HP documentation, their
`pthread.h' has to be included before any other header files, and our
code doesn't do that.)

If you use GCC, it may work, but some versions of GCC have omitted
certain important preprocessor defines, like `__STDC_EXT__' and
`__hpux'.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3,  Next: Solaris 2.X,  Prev: HPUX,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.7 Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3
---------------------------------------

The `gethostbyname()' routine is broken; it does not return a fully
qualified domain name, even if you are using the Domain Name Service
routines.  Since Kerberos V5 uses the fully qualified domain name as the
second component of a service principal (i.e,
`host/tsx-11.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'), this causes problems for servers
who try to figure out their own fully qualified domain name.

Workarounds:

  1.    Supply your own resolver library. (such as bind-4.9.3pl1
     available from ftp.vix.com)

  2.    Upgrade to Solaris 2.4

  3.    Make sure your /etc/nsswitch.conf has `files' before `dns' like:

          hosts:      files dns

     and then in /etc/hosts, make sure there is a line with your
     workstation's IP address and hostname, with the fully qualified
     domain name first.  Example:

          18.172.1.4      dcl.mit.edu dcl

     Note that making this change may cause other programs in your
     environment to break or behave differently.



File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Solaris 2.X,  Next: Solaris 9,  Prev: Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.8 Solaris 2.X
------------------

You must compile Kerberos V5 without the UCB compatibility libraries.
This means that `/usr/ucblib' must not be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable when you compile it.  Alternatively you can use
the `-i' option to `cc', by using the specifying `CFLAGS=-i' option to
`configure'.

If you are compiling for a 64-bit execution environment, you may need
to configure with the option `CFLAGS="-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500
-D__EXTENSIONS__"'.  This is not well tested; at MIT we work primarily
with the 32-bit execution environment.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Solaris 9,  Next: SGI Irix 5.X,  Prev: Solaris 2.X,  Up: OS Incompatibilities

3.10.9 Solaris 9
----------------

Solaris 9 has a kernel race condition which causes the final output
written to the slave side of a pty to be lost upon the final close() of
the slave device.  This causes the dejagnu-based tests to fail
intermittently.  A workaround exists, but requires some help from the
scheduler, and the "make check" must be executed from a shell with
elevated priority limits.

Run something like

`priocntl -s -c FX -m 30 -p 30 -i pid nnnn'

as root, where `nnnn' is the pid of the shell whose priority limit you
wish to raise.

Sun has released kernel patches for this race condition.  Apply patch
117171-11 for sparc, or patch 117172-11 for x86.  Later revisions of
the patches should also work.  It is not necessary to run "make check"

3.10.10 SGI Irix 5.X
--------------------

If you are building in a tree separate from the source tree, the vendors
version of make does not work properly with regards to `VPATH'. It also
has problems with standard inference rules in 5.2 (not tested yet in
5.3) so one needs to use GNU's make.

Under 5.2, there is a bug in the optional System V `-lsocket' library
in which the routine `gethostbyname()' is broken. The system supplied
version in `-lc' appears to work though so one may simply specify
`--with-netlib' option to `configure'.

In 5.3, `gethostbyname()' is no longer present in `-lsocket' and is no
longer an issue.

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Using Autoconf,  Prev: OS Incompatibilities,  Up: Building Kerberos V5

3.11 Using `Autoconf'
=====================

(If you are not a developer, you can skip this section.)

In most of the Kerberos V5 source directories, there is a `configure'
script which automatically determines the compilation environment and
creates the proper Makefiles for a particular platform.  These
`configure' files are generated using `autoconf', which can be found in
the `src/util/autoconf' directory in the distribution.

Normal users will not need to worry about running `autoconf'; the
distribution comes with the `configure' files already prebuilt.
Developers who wish to modify the `configure.in' files should see *Note
Overview: (autoconf)Top.

Note that in order to run `autoconf', you must have GNU `m4' in your
path.  Before you use the `autoconf' in the Kerberos V5 source tree,
you may also need to run `configure', and then run `make' in the
`src/util/autoconf' directory in order to properly set up `autoconf'.

One tool which is provided for the convenience of developers can be
found in `src/util/reconf'.  This program should be run while the
current directory is the top source directory.  It will automatically
rebuild any `configure' files which need rebuilding.  If you know that
you have made a change that will require that all the `configure' files
need to be rebuilt from scratch, specify the `--force' option:

     % cd /u1/krb5-1.7/src
     % ./util/reconf --force

The developmental sources are a raw source tree (before it's been
packaged for public release), without the pre-built `configure' files.
In order to build from such a source tree, you must do:

     % cd krb5/util/autoconf
     % ./configure
     % make
     % cd ../..
     % util/reconf

Then follow the instructions for building packaged source trees (above).
To install the binaries into a binary tree, do:

     % cd /u1/krb5-1.7/src
     % make all
     % make install DESTDIR=somewhere-else

4.1 Installing KDCs
===================

The Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) issue Kerberos tickets.  Each KDC
contains a copy of the Kerberos database.  The master KDC contains the
master copy of the database, which it propagates to the slave KDCs at
regular intervals.  All database changes (such as password changes) are
made on the master KDC.

Slave KDCs provide Kerberos ticket-granting services, but not database
administration.  This allows clients to continue to obtain tickets when
the master KDC is unavailable.

MIT recommends that you install all of your KDCs to be able to function
as either the master or one of the slaves.  This will enable you to
easily switch your master KDC with one of the slaves if necessary.
(*Note Switching Master and Slave KDCs::.)  This installation procedure
is based on that recommendation.

first few steps must be done on the master KDC.

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Edit the Configuration Files,  Next: krb5.conf,  Prev: Install the Master KDC,  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.1 Edit the Configuration Files
....................................

Modify the configuration files, `/etc/krb5.conf' and
`/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kdc.conf' to reflect the correct information
(such as the hostnames and realm name) for your realm.  MIT recommends
that you keep `krb5.conf' in `/etc'.

Most of the tags in the configuration have default values that will
work well for most sites.  There are some tags in the `krb5.conf' file
whose values must be specified, and this section will explain those as
well as give an overview of all of the sections in both configuration
files.  For more information on changing defaults with the
configuration files, see the Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide
sections on configuration files.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: krb5.conf,  Next: kdc.conf,  Prev: Edit the Configuration Files,  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.2 krb5.conf
.................

The `krb5.conf' file contains Kerberos configuration information,
including the locations of KDCs and admin servers for the Kerberos
realms of interest, defaults for the current realm and for Kerberos
applications, and mappings of hostnames onto Kerberos realms.  Normally,
you should install your `krb5.conf' file in the directory `/etc'.  You
can override the default location by setting the environment variable
`KRB5_CONFIG'.

The `krb5.conf' file is set up in the style of a Windows INI file.
Sections are headed by the section name, in square brackets.  Each
section may contain zero or more relations, of the form:

     foo = bar

or

     fubar = {
             foo = bar
             baz = quux
     }

Placing a `*' at the end of a line indicates that this is the "final"
value for the tag.  This means that neither the remainder of this
configuration file nor any other configuration file will be checked for
any other values for this tag.

For example, if you have the following lines:

     foo = bar*
     foo = baz

then the second value of foo (baz) would never be read.

The `krb5.conf' file may contain any or all of the following sections:

libdefaults
     Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 library.

login
     Contains default values used by the Kerberos V5 login program.

appdefaults
     Contains default values that can be used by Kerberos V5
     applications.

realms
     Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm names.  Each
     subsection describes realm-specific information, including where
     to find the Kerberos servers for that realm.

domain_realm
     Contains relations which map domain names and subdomains onto
     Kerberos realm names.  This is used by programs to determine what
     realm a host should be in, given its fully qualified domain name.

logging
     Contains relations which determine how Kerberos programs are to
     perform logging.

capaths
     Contains the authentication paths used with direct
     (nonhierarchical) cross-realm authentication.  Entries in this
     section are used by the client to determine the intermediate
     realms which may be used in cross-realm authentication.  It is
     also used by the end-service when checking the transited field for
     trusted intermediate realms.


If you are not using DNS TXT records, you must specify the
`default_realm' in the `libdefaults' section.  If you are not using DNS
SRV records, you must include the `kdc' tag for each realm in the
`realms' section.  To communicate with the kadmin server in each realm,
the `admin_server' tag must be set in the `realms' section.  If your
domain name and realm name are not the same, you must provide a
translation in `domain_realm'.  It is also higly recommeneded that you
create a `[logging]' stanza if the computer will be functioning as a
KDC so that the KDC and kadmind will generate logging output.

An example `krb5.conf' file:

     [libdefaults]
         default_realm = ATHENA.MIT.EDU

     [realms]
         ATHENA.MIT.EDU = {
         	kdc = kerberos.mit.edu
         	kdc = kerberos-1.mit.edu
         	kdc = kerberos-2.mit.edu
         	admin_server = kerberos.mit.edu
         {

     [logging]
         kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
         admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmin.log
         default = FILE:/var/log/krb5lib.log


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: kdc.conf,  Next: Create the Database,  Prev: krb5.conf,  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.3 kdc.conf
................

The `kdc.conf' file contains KDC configuration information, including
defaults used when issuing Kerberos tickets.  Normally, you should
install your `kdc.conf' file in the directory `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc'.
You can override the default location by setting the environment
variable `KRB5_KDC_PROFILE'.

The `kdc.conf' file is set up in the same format as the `krb5.conf'
file.  (*Note krb5.conf::.)  The `kdc.conf' file may contain any or all
of the following three sections:

kdcdefaults
     Contains default values for overall behavior of the KDC.

realms
     Contains subsections keyed by Kerberos realm names.  Each
     subsection describes realm-specific information, including where
     to find the Kerberos servers for that realm.

logging
     Contains relations which determine how Kerberos programs are to
     perform logging.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Create the Database,  Next: Add Administrators to the Acl File,  Prev: kdc.conf,  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.4 Create the Database
...........................

You will use the `kdb5_util' command _on the Master KDC_ to create the
Kerberos database and the optional stash file.  The "stash file" is a
local copy of the master key that resides in encrypted form on the
KDC's local disk.  The stash file is used to authenticate the KDC to
itself automatically before starting the `kadmind' and `krb5kdc'
daemons (e.g., as part of the machine's boot sequence).  The stash
file, like the keytab file (see *Note The Keytab File::, for more
information) is a potential point-of-entry for a break-in, and if
compromised, would allow unrestricted access to the Kerberos database.
If you choose to install a stash file, it should be readable only by
root, and should exist only on the KDC's local disk.  The file should
not be part of any backup of the machine, unless access to the backup
data is secured as tightly as access to the master password itself.

If you choose not to install a stash file, the KDC will prompt you for
the master key each time it starts up.  This means that the KDC will
not be able to start automatically, such as after a system reboot.

Note that `kdb5_util' will prompt you for the master key for the
Kerberos database.  This key can be any string.  A good key is one you
can remember, but that no one else can guess.  Examples of bad keys are
words that can be found in a dictionary, any common or popular name,
especially a famous person (or cartoon character), your username in any
form (e.g., forward, backward, repeated twice, etc.), and any of the
sample keys that appear in this manual.  One example of a key which
might be good if it did not appear in this manual is "MITiys4K5!",
which represents the sentence "MIT is your source for Kerberos 5!"
(It's the first letter of each word, substituting the numeral "4" for
the word "for", and includes the punctuation mark at the end.)

The following is an example of how to create a Kerberos database and
stash file on the master KDC, using the `kdb5_util' command.  (The line
that begins with => is a continuation of the previous line.)  Replace
ATHENA.MIT.EDU with the name of your Kerberos realm.

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util create -r ATHENA.MIT.EDU -s
     Initializing database '/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal' for
     => realm 'ATHENA.MIT.EDU',
     master key name 'K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
     You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
     It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.
     Enter KDC database master key:  <= Type the master password.
     Re-enter KDC database master key to verify:  <= Type it again.
     shell%

This will create five files in the directory specified in your
`kdc.conf' file:  two Kerberos database files, `principal.db', and
`principal.ok'; the Kerberos administrative database file,
`principal.kadm5'; the administrative database lock file,
`principal.kadm5.lock'; and the stash file, `.k5stash'.  (The default
directory is `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc'.)  If you do not want a stash
file, run the above command without the `-s' option.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Add Administrators to the Acl File,  Next: Add Administrators to the Kerberos Database,  Prev: Create the Database,  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.5 Add Administrators to the Acl File
..........................................

Next, you need create an Access Control List (acl) file, and put the
Kerberos principal of at least one of the administrators into it.  This
file is used by the `kadmind' daemon to control which principals may
view and make privileged modifications to the Kerberos database files.
The filename should match the value you have set for "acl_file" in your
`kdc.conf' file.  The default file name is
`/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl'.

The format of the file is:

     Kerberos_principal      permissions     [target_principal]	[restrictions]

The Kerberos principal (and optional target principal) can include the
"*" wildcard, so if you want any principal with the instance "admin" to
have full permissions on the database, you could use the principal
"`*/admin@REALM'" where "REALM" is your Kerberos realm.
`target_principal' can also include backreferences to
`Kerberos_principal', in which "*number" matches the component number
in the `Kerberos_principal'.

Note:  a common use of an admin instance is so you can grant separate
permissions (such as administrator access to the Kerberos database) to
a separate Kerberos principal.  For example, the user `joeadmin' might
have a principal for his administrative use, called `joeadmin/admin'.
This way, `joeadmin' would obtain `joeadmin/admin' tickets only when he
actually needs to use those permissions.

The permissions are represented by single letters; UPPER-CASE letters
represent negative permissions.  The permissions are:

a
     allows the addition of principals or policies in the database.

A
     disallows the addition of principals or policies in the database.

d
     allows the deletion of principals or policies in the database.

D
     disallows the deletion of principals or policies in the database.

m
     allows the modification of principals or policies in the database.

M
     disallows the modification of principals or policies in the
     database.

c
     allows the changing of passwords for principals in the database.

C
     disallows the changing of passwords for principals in the database.

i
     allows inquiries to the database.

I
     disallows inquiries to the database.

l
     allows the listing of principals or policies in the database.

L
     disallows the listing of principals or policies in the database.

s
     allows the explicit setting of the key for a principal

S
     disallows the explicit setting of the key for a principal

*
     All privileges (admcil).

x
     All privileges (admcil); identical to "*".

The restrictions are a string of flags.  Allowed restrictions are:

[+ -]flagname
     flag is forced to indicated value.  The permissible flags are the
     same as the `+' and `-' flags for the `kadmin addprinc' and
     `modprinc' commands.

-clearpolicy
     policy is forced to clear

-policy pol
     policy is forced to be pol

expire time
pwexpire time
maxlife time
maxrenewlife time
     associated value will be forced to MIN(time, requested value)

The above flags act as restrictions on any add or modify operation
which is allowed due to that ACL line.

Here is an example of a `kadm5.acl' file.  Note that order is
important; permissions are determined by the first matching entry.

     */admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  *
     joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  ADMCIL
     joeadmin/*@ATHENA.MIT.EDU il */root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     *@ATHENA.MIT.EDU cil *1/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     */*@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  i
     */admin@EXAMPLE.COM * -maxlife 9h -postdateable

In the above file, any principal in the ATHENA.MIT.EDU realm with an
`admin' instance has all administrative privileges.  The user `joeadmin'
has all permissions with his `admin' instance,
`joeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU' (matches the first line).  He has no
permissions at all with his `null' instance, `joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
(matches the second line).  His root instance has inquire and list
permissions with any other principal that has the instance `root'.  Any
principal in ATHENA.MIT.EDU can inquire, list, or change the password of
their `admin' instance, but not any other `admin' instance.  Any
principal in the realm `ATHENA.MIT.EDU' (except for
`joeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU', as mentioned above) has inquire privileges.
Finally, any principal with an admin instance in EXAMPLE.COM has all
permissions, but any principal that they create or modify will not be
able to get postdateable tickets or tickets with a life of longer than
9 hours.

4.1.1.6 Add Administrators to the Kerberos Database
...................................................

Next you need to add administrative principals to the Kerberos database.
(You must add at least one now.)  To do this, use `kadmin.local' _on
the master KDC_.  The administrative principals you create should be
the ones you added to the ACL file.  (See *Note Add Administrators to
the Acl File::.)  In the following example, the administration
principal `admin/admin' is created:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
     kadmin.local: addprinc admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     NOTICE: no policy specified for "admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     assigning "default".
     Enter password for principal admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Enter a password.
     Re-enter password for principal admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU:  <= Type it again.
     Principal "admin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin.local:


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Create a kadmind Keytab (optional),  Next: Start the Kerberos Daemons,  Prev: Add Administrators to the Kerberos Database,  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.7 Create a kadmind Keytab (optional)
..........................................

The kadmind keytab is the key that the legacy admininstration daemons
`kadmind4' and `v5passwdd' will use to decrypt administrators' or
clients' Kerberos tickets to determine whether or not they should have
access to the database.  You need to create the kadmin keytab with
entries for the principals `kadmin/admin' and `kadmin/changepw'.
(These principals are placed in the Kerberos database automatically
when you create it.)  To create the kadmin keytab, run `kadmin.local'
and use the `ktadd' command, as in the following example.  (The line
beginning with => is a continuation of the previous line.):

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
     kadmin.local: ktadd -k /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab
     => kadmin/admin kadmin/changepw
      Entry for principal kadmin/admin with kvno 5, encryption
     	type Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 added to keytab
     	WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.
     Entry for principal kadmin/admin with kvno 5, encryption type DES cbc mode
     	with CRC-32 added to keytab
     	WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.
     Entry for principal kadmin/changepw with kvno 5, encryption
     	type Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 added to keytab
     	WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.
     Entry for principal kadmin/changepw with kvno 5,
     	encryption type DES cbc mode with CRC-32 added to keytab
     	WRFILE:/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab.
     kadmin.local: quit
     shell%

As specified in the `-k' argument, `ktadd' will save the extracted
keytab as
`/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab'.  The filename you use must be
the one specified in your `kdc.conf' file.


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Start the Kerberos Daemons,  Prev: Create a kadmind Keytab (optional),  Up: Install the Master KDC

4.1.1.8 Start the Kerberos Daemons on the Master KDC
....................................................

At this point, you are ready to start the Kerberos daemons on the Master
KDC.  To do so, type:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc
     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmind

Each daemon will fork and run in the background.  Assuming you want
these daemons to start up automatically at boot time, you can add them
to the KDC's `/etc/rc' or `/etc/inittab' file.  You need to have a
stash file in order to do this.

You can verify that they started properly by checking for their startup
messages in the logging locations you defined in `/etc/krb5.conf'.
(*Note Edit the Configuration Files::.)  For example:

     shell% tail /var/log/krb5kdc.log
     Dec 02 12:35:47 beeblebrox krb5kdc[3187](info): commencing operation
     shell% tail /var/log/kadmin.log
     Dec 02 12:35:52 beeblebrox kadmind[3189](info): starting

Any errors the daemons encounter while starting will also be listed in
the logging output.

You are now ready to start configuring the slave KDCs.  Assuming you are

4.1.2.1 Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs
...........................................

Each KDC needs a host principal in the Kerberos database.  You can enter
these from any host, once the `kadmind' daemon is running.  For
example, if your master KDC were called kerberos.mit.edu, and you had
two KDC slaves named kerberos-1.mit.edu and kerberos-2.mit.edu, you
would type the following:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
     kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/kerberos.mit.edu
     NOTICE: no policy specified for "host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     assigning "default"
     Principal "host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/kerberos-1.mit.edu
     NOTICE: no policy specified for "host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     assigning "default"
     Principal "host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/kerberos-2.mit.edu
     NOTICE: no policy specified for "host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU";
     assigning "default"
     Principal "host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU" created.
     kadmin:

It is not actually necessary to have the master KDC server in the
Kerberos database, but it can be handy if:

   * anyone will be logging into the machine as something other than
     root

   * you want to be able to swap the master KDC with one of the slaves
     if necessary.

4.1.2.2 Extract Host Keytabs for the KDCs
.........................................

Each KDC (including the master) needs a keytab to decrypt tickets.
Ideally, you should extract each keytab locally on its own KDC.  If this
is not feasible, you should use an encrypted session to send them across
the network.  To extract a keytab on a KDC called kerberos.mit.edu, you
would execute the following command:

     kadmin: ktadd host/kerberos.mit.edu
     kadmin: Entry for principal host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
          kvno 1, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
          WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin:

Note that the principal must exist in the Kerberos database in order to
extract the keytab.

4.1.2.3 Set Up the Slave KDCs for Database Propagation
......................................................

The database is propagated from the master KDC to the slave KDCs via the
`kpropd' daemon.  To set up propagation, create a file on each KDC,
named `/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl', containing the principals
for each of the KDCs.  For example, if the master KDC were
`kerberos.mit.edu', the slave KDCs were `kerberos-1.mit.edu' and
`kerberos-2.mit.edu', and the realm were `ATHENA.MIT.EDU', then the
file's contents would be:

     host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

Then, add the following lines to `/etc/inetd.conf' file on each KDC
(the line beginnng with => is a continuation of the previous line):

     krb5_prop stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/kpropd kpropd
     eklogin   stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/klogind
     => klogind -k -c -e

The first line sets up the `kpropd' database propagation daemon.  The
second line sets up the `eklogin' daemon, allowing
Kerberos-authenticated, encrypted rlogin to the KDC.

You also need to add the following lines to `/etc/services' on each KDC:

     kerberos        88/udp      kdc       # Kerberos authentication (udp)
     kerberos        88/tcp      kdc       # Kerberos authentication (tcp)
     krb5_prop       754/tcp               # Kerberos slave propagation
     kerberos-adm    749/tcp               # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw (tcp)
     kerberos-adm    749/udp               # Kerberos 5 admin/changepw (udp)
     eklogin         2105/tcp              # Kerberos encrypted rlogin

----------------------------

Now that the slave KDCs are able to accept database propagation, you'll
need to propagate the database to each of them.

4.1.3.1 Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC
................................................

First, create a dump of the database on the master KDC, as follows:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util dump /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     shell%

Next, you need to manually propagate the database to each slave KDC, as
in the following example.  (The lines beginning with => are
continuations of the previous line.):

     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     => kerberos-1.mit.edu
     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
     => kerberos-2.mit.edu

You will need a script to dump and propagate the database.  The
following is an example of a bourne shell script that will do this.
(Note that the line that begins with => is a continuation of the
previous line.  Remember that you need to replace /usr/local with the
name of the directory in which you installed Kerberos V5.)

     #!/bin/sh

     kdclist = "kerberos-1.mit.edu kerberos-2.mit.edu"

     /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util "dump
     => /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans"

     for kdc in $kdclist
     do
     /usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans $kdc
     done

You will need to set up a cron job to run this script at the intervals
you decided on earlier (*Note Database Propagation::.)

4.1.4 Finish Installing the Slave KDCs
--------------------------------------

Now that the slave KDCs have copies of the Kerberos database, you can
create stash files for them and start the `krb5kdc' daemon.

* Menu:

* Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs::
* Start the krb5kdc Daemon on Each KDC::


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs,  Next: Start the krb5kdc Daemon on Each KDC,  Prev: Finish Installing the Slave KDCs,  Up: Finish Installing the Slave KDCs

4.1.4.1 Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs
............................................

Create stash files, by issuing the following commands on each slave KDC:

     shell% kdb5_util stash
     kdb5_util: Cannot find/read stored master key while reading master key
     kdb5_util: Warning: proceeding without master key
     Enter KDC database master key:  <= Enter the database master key.
     shell%

As mentioned above, the stash file is necessary for your KDCs to be able
authenticate to themselves, such as when they reboot.  You could run
your KDCs without stash files, but you would then need to type in the
Kerberos database master key by hand every time you start a KDC daemon.

4.1.4.2 Start the krb5kdc Daemon on Each KDC
............................................

The final step in configuing your slave KDCs is to run the KDC daemon:

     shell% /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc

As with the master KDC, you will probably want to add this command to
the KDCs' `/etc/rc' or `/etc/inittab' files, so they will start the
krb5kdc daemon automatically at boot time.

4.1.5 Add Kerberos Principals to the Database
---------------------------------------------

Once your KDCs are set up and running, you are ready to use `kadmin' to
load principals for your users, hosts, and other services into the
Kerberos database.  This procedure is described fully in the "Adding or
Modifying Principals" section of the Kerberos V5 System Administrator's
Guide.  (*Note Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs::, for a brief
description.)  The keytab is generated by running `kadmin' and issuing
the `ktadd' command.

4.1.6 Limit Access to the KDCs
------------------------------

To limit the possibility that your Kerberos database could be
compromised, MIT recommends that each KDC be a dedicated host, with
limited access.  If your KDC is also a file server, FTP server, Web
server, or even just a client machine, someone who obtained root access
through a security hole in any of those areas could gain access to the
Kerberos database.

MIT recommends that your KDCs use the following `/etc/inetd.conf' file.
(Note:  each line beginning with => is a continuation of the previous
line.):

     #
     # Configuration file for inetd(1M).  See inetd.conf(4).
     #
     # To re-configure the running inetd process, edit this file, then
     # send the inetd process a SIGHUP.

     # Services are limited.

4.1.7 Switching Master and Slave KDCs
-------------------------------------

You may occasionally want to use one of your slave KDCs as the master.
This might happen if you are upgrading the master KDC, or if your master
KDC has a disk crash.

Assuming you have configured all of your KDCs to be able to function as
either the master KDC or a slave KDC (as this document recommends), all
you need to do to make the changeover is:

If the master KDC is still running, do the following on the _old_
master KDC:

  1. Kill the `kadmind' process.

  2. Disable the cron job that propagates the database.

  3. Run your database propagation script manually, to ensure that the
     slaves all have the latest copy of the database.  (*Note Propagate
     the Database to Each Slave KDC::.)  If there is a need to preserve
     per-principal policy information from the database, you should do
     a "kdb5_util dump -ov" in order to preserve that information and
     propogate that dump file securely by some means to the slave so
     that its database has the correct state of the per-principal
     policy information.

On the _new_ master KDC:

  1. Create a database keytab.  (*Note Create a kadmind Keytab
     (optional)::.)

  2. Start the `kadmind' daemon.  (*Note Start the Kerberos Daemons::.)

  3. Set up the cron job to propagate the database.  (*Note Propagate
     the Database to Each Slave KDC::.)

  4. Switch the CNAMEs of the old and new master KDCs.  (If you don't do
     this, you'll need to change the `krb5.conf' file on every client
     machine in your Kerberos realm.)



File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Incremental Database Propagation,  Prev: Switching Master and Slave KDCs,  Up: Installing KDCs

4.1.8 Incremental Database Propagation
--------------------------------------

At some very large sites, dumping and transmitting the database can
take more time than is desirable for changes to propagate from the
master KDC to the slave KDCs.  The incremental propagation support
added in the 1.7 release is intended to address this.

With incremental propagation enabled, all programs on the master KDC
that change the database also write information about the changes to an
"update log" file, maintained as a circular buffer of a certain size.
A process on each slave KDC connects to a service on the master KDC
(currently implmented in the `kadmind' server) and periodically
requests the changes that have been made since the last check.  By
default, this check is done every two minutes.  If the database has
just been modified in the previous several seconds (currently the
threshold is hard-coded at 10 seconds), the slave will not retrieve
updates, but instead will pause and try again soon after.  This reduces
the likelihood that incremental update queries will cause delays for an
administrator trying to make a bunch of changes to the database at the
same time.

Incremental propagation uses the following entries in the per-realm
data in the KDC config file:

`iprop_enable' (boolean)
     If this is set to `true', then incremental propagation is enabled,
     and (as noted below) normal `kprop' propagation is disabled.  The
     default is `false'.

`iprop_master_ulogsize' (integer)
     This indicates the number of entries that should be retained in the
     update log.  The default is 1000; the maximum number is 2500.

`iprop_slave_poll' (time interval)
     This indicates how often the slave should poll the master KDC for
     changes to the database.  The default is two minutes.

`iprop_port' (integer)
     This specifies the port number to be used for incremental
     propagation.  This is required in both master and slave
     configuration files.

`iprop_logfile' (file name)
     This specifies where the update log file for the realm database is
     to be stored.  The default is to use the `database_name' entry from
     the `realms' section of the config file, with `.ulog' appended.
     (NOTE: If `database_name' isn't specified in the `realms' section,
     perhaps because the LDAP database back end is being used, or the
     file name is specified in the `dbmodules' section, then the
     hard-coded default for `database_name' is used.  Determination of
     the `iprop_logfile' default value will not use values from the
     `dbmodules' section.)

Both master and slave sides must have principals named
`kiprop/HOSTNAME' (where HOSTNAME is, as usual, the lower-case,
fully-qualified, canonical name for the host) registered and keys
stored in the default keytab file (`/etc/krb5.keytab').

On the master KDC side, the `kiprop/HOSTNAME' principal must be listed
in the `kadmind' ACL file `kadm5.acl', and given the `p' privilege.

On the slave KDC side, `kpropd' should be run.  When incremental
propagation is enabled, it will connect to the `kadmind' on the master
KDC and start requesting updates.

The normal `kprop' mechanism is disabled by the incremental propagation
support.  However, if the slave has been unable to fetch changes from
the master KDC for too long (network problems, perhaps), the log on the
master may wrap around and overwrite some of the updates that the slave
has not yet retrieved.  In this case, the slave will instruct the
master KDC to dump the current database out to a file and invoke a
one-time `kprop' propagation, with special options to also convey the
point in the update log at which the slave should resume fetching
incremental updates.  Thus, all the keytab and ACL setup previously
described for `kprop' propagation is still needed.

There are several known bugs and restrictions in the current
implementation:
   * The "call out to `kprop'" mechanism is a bit fragile; if the
     `kprop' propagation fails to connect for some reason, the process
     on the slave may hang waiting for it, and will need to be
     restarted.

   * The master and slave must be able to initiate TCP connections in
     both directions, without an intervening NAT.  They must also be
     able to communicate over IPv4, since MIT's kprop and RPC code does
     not currently support IPv6.

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Sun/MIT Incremental Propagation Differences,  Prev: Incremental Database Propagation,  Up: Incremental Database Propagation

4.1.8.1 Sun/MIT Incremental Propagation Differences
...................................................

Sun donated the original code for supporting incremental database
propagation to MIT.  Some changes have been made in the MIT source tree
that will be visible to administrators.  (These notes are based on
Sun's patches.  Changes to Sun's implementation since then may not be
reflected here.)

The Sun config file support looks for `sunw_dbprop_enable',
`sunw_dbprop_master_ulogsize', and `sunw_dbprop_slave_poll'.

The incremental propagation service is implemented as an ONC RPC
service.  In the Sun implementation, the service is registered with
`rpcbind' (also known as `portmapper') and the client looks up the port
number to contact.  In the MIT implementation, where interaction with
some modern versions of `rpcbind' doesn't always work well, the port
number must be specified in the config file on both the master and
slave sides.

The Sun implementation hard-codes pathnames in `/var/krb5' for the
update log and the per-slave `kprop' dump files.  In the MIT
implementation, the pathname for the update log is specified in the
config file, and the per-slave dump files are stored in
`/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans_HOSTNAME'.

4.2.1 Client Programs
---------------------

The Kerberized client programs are `login.krb5', `rlogin', `telnet',
`ftp', `rcp', `rsh', `kinit', `klist', `kdestroy', `kpasswd', `ksu', and
`krb524init'.  All of these programs are in the directory
`/usr/local/bin', except for `login.krb5' which is in `/usr/local/sbin'.

You will probably want to have your users put `/usr/local/bin' ahead of
`/bin' and `/usr/bin' in their paths, so they will by default get the
Kerberos V5 versions of `rlogin', `telnet', `ftp', `rcp', and `rsh'.

MIT recommends that you use `login.krb5' in place of `/bin/login' to
give your users a single-sign-on system.  You will need to make sure
your users know to use their Kerberos passwords when they log in.

You will also need to educate your users to use the ticket management
programs `kinit', `klist', `kdestroy', and to use the Kerberos programs
`ksu', and `kpasswd' in place of their non-Kerberos counterparts `su',
`passwd', and `rdist'.

Each machine running Kerberos must have a `/etc/krb5.conf' file.
(*Note krb5.conf::.)

Also, for most UNIX systems, you must add the appropriate Kerberos
services to each client machine's `/etc/services' file.  If you are
using the default configuration for Kerberos V5, you should be able to
just insert the following code:

     kerberos      88/udp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC
     kerberos      88/tcp    kdc    # Kerberos V5 KDC

File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Mac OS X Configuration,  Prev: Client Machine Configuration Files,  Up: Client Machine Configuration Files

4.2.2.1 Mac OS X Configuration
..............................

To install Kerberos V5 on Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server, follow the
directions for generic Unix-based OS's, except for the `/etc/services'
updates described above.

Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server use a database called NetInfo to store the
contents of files normally found in `/etc'.  Instead of modifying
`/etc/services', you should run the following commands to add the
Kerberos service entries to NetInfo:

     $ niutil -create . /services/kerberos
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kerberos name kerberos kdc
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kerberos port 750
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kerberos protocol tcp udp
     $ niutil -create . /services/krbupdate
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/krbupdate name krbupdate kreg
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/krbupdate port 760
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/krbupdate protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/kpasswd
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kpasswd name kpasswd kpwd
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kpasswd port 761
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kpasswd protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/klogin
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/klogin port 543
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/klogin protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/eklogin
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/eklogin port 2105
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/eklogin protocol tcp
     $ niutil -create . /services/kshell
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kshell name kshell krcmd
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kshell port 544
     $ niutil -createprop . /services/kshell protocol tcp

In addition to adding services to NetInfo, you must also modify the
resolver configuration in NetInfo so that the machine resolves its own
hostname as a FQDN (fully qualified domain name).  By default, Mac OS X
and Mac OS X Server machines query NetInfo to resolve hostnames before
falling back to DNS.  Because NetInfo has an unqualified name for all
the machines in the NetInfo database, the machine's own hostname will
resolve to an unqualified name.  Kerberos needs a FQDN to look up keys
in the machine's keytab file.

Fortunately, you can change the `lookupd' caching order to query DNS
first.  Run the following NetInfo commands and reboot the machine:

     $ niutil -create . /locations/lookupd/hosts
     $ niutil -createprop . /locations/lookupd/hosts LookupOrder CacheAgent DNSAgent
      NIAgent NILAgent

Once you have rebooted, you can verify that the resolver now behaves
correctly.  Compile the Kerberos 5 distribution and run:

     $ cd .../src/tests/resolve
     $ ./resolve

This will tell you whether or not your machine returns FQDNs on name
lookups.  If the test still fails, you can also try turning off DNS
caching.  Run the following commands and reboot:

     $ niutil -create . /locations/lookupd/hosts
     $ niutil -createprop . /locations/lookupd/hosts LookupOrder DNSAgent
      CacheAgent NIAgent NILAgent

The remainder of the setup of a Mac OS X client machine or application
server should be the same as for other UNIX-based systems.

4.3 UNIX Application Servers
============================

An application server is a host that provides one or more services over
the network.  Application servers can be "secure" or "insecure."  A
"secure" host is set up to require authentication from every client
connecting to it.  An "insecure" host will still provide Kerberos
authentication, but will also allow unauthenticated clients to connect.

If you have Kerberos V5 installed on all of your client machines,
MIT recommends that you make your hosts secure, to take advantage of
the security that Kerberos authentication affords.  However, if you
have some clients that do not have Kerberos V5 installed, you can run
an insecure server, and still take advantage of Kerberos V5's single
sign-on capability.

client UNIX network programs, Kerberos V5 also provides
Kerberos-enhanced versions of server UNIX network daemons.  These are
`ftpd', `klogind', `kshd', and `telnetd'.  These programs are installed
in the directory `/usr/local/sbin'.  You may want to add this directory
to root's path.

--------------------------------

For a _secure_ server, make the following changes to `/etc/inetd.conf':

Find and comment out any lines for the services `ftp', `telnet',
`shell', `login', and `exec'.

Add the following lines.  (Note:  each line beginning with => is a
continuation of the previous line.)

4.3.3 The Keytab File
---------------------

All Kerberos server machines need a "keytab" file, called
`/etc/krb5.keytab', to authenticate to the KDC.  The keytab file is an
encrypted, local, on-disk copy of the host's key.  The keytab file,
like the stash file (*Note Create the Database::) is a potential
point-of-entry for a break-in, and if compromised, would allow
unrestricted access to its host.  The keytab file should be readable
only by root, and should exist only on the machine's local disk.  The
file should not be part of any backup of the machine, unless access to
the backup data is secured as tightly as access to the machine's root
password itself.

In order to generate a keytab for a host, the host must have a principal
in the Kerberos database.  The procedure for adding hosts to the
database is described fully in the "Adding or Modifying Principals"
section of the `Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide'.  *Note
Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs::. for a brief description.)  The
keytab is generated by running `kadmin' and issuing the `ktadd' command.

For example, to generate a keytab file to allow the host
trillium.mit.edu to authenticate for the services `host', `ftp', and
`pop', the administrator `joeadmin' would issue the command (on
trillium.mit.edu):

     trillium% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
     kadmin5: ktadd host/trillium.mit.edu ftp/trillium.mit.edu
     => pop/trillium.mit.edu
     kadmin: Entry for principal host/trillium.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin: Entry for principal ftp/trillium.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin: Entry for principal pop/trillium.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 3, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
     kadmin5: quit
     trillium%

If you generate the keytab file on another host, you need to get a copy
of the keytab file onto the destination host (`trillium', in the above
example) without sending it unencrypted over the network.  If you have
installed the Kerberos V5 client programs, you can use encrypted `rcp'.

4.3.4 Some Advice about Secure Hosts
------------------------------------

Kerberos V5 can protect your host from certain types of break-ins, but
it is possible to install Kerberos V5 and still leave your host
vulnerable to attack.  Obviously an installation guide is not the place
to try to include an exhaustive list of countermeasures for every
possible attack, but it is worth noting some of the larger holes and how
to close them.

As stated earlier in this section, MIT recommends that on a secure
host, you disable the standard `ftp', `login', `telnet', `shell', and
`exec' services in `/etc/inetd.conf'.  We also recommend that secure
hosts have an empty `/etc/hosts.equiv' file and that there not be a
`.rhosts' file in `root''s home directory.  You can grant
Kerberos-authenticated root access to specific Kerberos principals by
placing those principals in the file `.k5login' in root's home
directory.

We recommend that backups of secure machines exclude the keytab file
(`/etc/krb5.keytab').  If this is not possible, the backups should at
least be done locally, rather than over a network, and the backup tapes
should be physically secured.

Finally, the keytab file and any programs run by root, including the
Kerberos V5 binaries, should be kept on local disk.  The keytab file
should be readable only by root.

5 Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations
**********************************************

If you already have an existing Kerberos database that you created with
a prior release of Kerberos 5, you can upgrade it to work with the
current release with the `kdb5_util' command.  It is only necessary to
perform this dump/undump procedure if you were running a krb5-1.0.x KDC
and are migrating to a krb5-1.1.x or newer KDC or if you were running a
krb5-1.1.x KDC and are migrating to a krb5-1.2.x or newer KDC.  The
process for upgrading a Master KDC involves the following steps:

  1. Stop your current KDC and administration server processes, if any.

  2. Dump your existing Kerberos database to an ASCII file with
     `kdb5_util''s "dump" command:

          shell% cd /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
          shell% kdb5_util dump old-kdb-dump
          shell% kdb5_util dump -ov old-kdb-dump.ov
          shell%

  3. Create a new Master KDC installation (*Note Install the Master
     KDC::.).  If you have a stash file for your current database,
     choose any new master password but then copy your existing stash
     file to the location specified by your kdc.conf; if you do not
     have a stash file for your current database, you must choose the
     same master password.

  4. Load your old Kerberos database into the new system with
     `kdb5_util''s "load" command:

          shell% cd /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
          shell% kdb5_util load old-kdb-dump
          shell% kdb5_util load -update old-kdb-dump.ov
          shell%


The "dump -ov" and "load -update" commands are necessary in order to
preserve per-principal policy information, since the default dump format
filters out that information.  If you omit those steps, the loaded
database database will lose the policy information for each principal
that has a policy.

To update a Slave KDC, you must stop the old server processes on the
Slave KDC, install the new server binaries, reload the most recent slave
dump file, and re-start the server processes.

* Upgrading to Triple-DES and RC4 Encryption Keys::


File: krb5-install.info,  Node: Upgrading to Triple-DES and RC4 Encryption Keys,  Prev: Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations,  Up: Upgrading Existing Kerberos V5 Installations

5.1 Upgrading to Triple-DES Encryption Keys
===========================================

Beginning with the 1.2 release from MIT, Kerberos includes a stronger
encryption algorithm called "triple DES" - essentially, three
applications of the basic DES encryption algorithm, greatly increasing
the resistance to a brute-force search for the key by an attacker.
This algorithm is more secure, but encryption is much slower.

Release 1.1 had some support for triple-DES service keys, but with
release 1.2 we have added support for user keys and session keys as
well.  Release 1.0 had very little support for multiple cryptosystems,
and some of that software may not function properly in an environment
using triple-DES as well as plain DES.

In the 1.3 release from MIT, Kerberos also includes the RC4 encryption
alogorithm, a stream cipher symmetric key algorithm developed in 1987
by Ronald Rivest at RSA Data Security.  Please note that RC4 is not
part of the IETF standard.

Because of the way the MIT Kerberos database is structured, the KDC
will assume that a service supports only those encryption types for
which keys are found in the database.  Thus, if a service has only a
single-DES key in the database, the KDC will not issue tickets for that
service that use triple-DES or RC4 session keys; it will instead issue
only single-DES session keys, even if other services are already
capable of using triple-DES or RC4.  So if you make sure your
application server software is updated before adding a triple-DES or
RC4 key for the service, clients should be able to talk to services at
all times during the updating process.

Normally, the listed `supported_enctypes' in `kdc.conf' are all used
when a new key is generated.  You can control this with command-line
flags to `kadmin' and `kadmin.local'.  You may want to exclude
triple-DES and RC4 by default until you have updated a lot of your
application servers, and then change the default to include triple-DES
and RC4.  We recommend that you always include `des-cbc-crc' in the
default list.

6 Bug Reports for Kerberos V5
*****************************

In any complex software, there will be bugs.  If you have successfully
built and installed Kerberos V5, please use the `krb5-send-pr' program
to fill out a Problem Report should you encounter any errors in our
software.

Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
do include fixes, please send them using either context diffs or unified
diffs (using `diff -c' or `diff -u', respectively).  Please be careful
when using "cut and paste" or other such means to copy a patch into a
bug report; depending on the system being used, that can result in
converting TAB characters into spaces, which makes applying the patches
more difficult.

The `krb5-send-pr' program is installed in the directory
`/usr/local/sbin'.

The `krb5-send-pr' program enters the problem report into our Problem
Report Management System (PRMS), which automatically assigns it to the
engineer best able to help you with problems in the assigned category.

The `krb5-send-pr' program will try to intelligently fill in as many
fields as it can.  You need to choose the "category", "class",
"severity", and "priority" of the problem, as well as giving us as much
information as you can about its exact nature.

The PR category will be one of:

     krb5-admin   krb5-appl    krb5-build   krb5-clients
     krb5-doc     krb5-kdc     krb5-libs    krb5-misc
     pty          telnet       test

Choose the category that best describes the area under which your
problem falls.

The class can be "sw-bug", "doc-bug", "change-request", or "support".
The first two are exactly as their names imply.  Use change-request
when the software is behaving according to specifications, but you want
to request changes in some feature or behavior.  The support class is
intended for more general questions about building or using Kerberos V5.

The severity of the problem indicates the problem's impact on the
usability of Kerberos V5.  If a problem is "critical", that means the
product, component or concept is completely non-operational, or some
essential functionality is missing, and no workaround is known.  A
"serious" problem is one in which the product, component or concept is
not working properly or significant functionality is missing.  Problems
that would otherwise be considered critical are rated serious when a
workaround is known.  A "non-critical" problem is one that is indeed a
problem, but one that is having a minimal effect on your ability to use
Kerberos V5.  E.g., The product, component or concept is working in
general, but lacks features, has irritating behavior, does something
wrong, or doesn't match its documentation.  The default severity is
serious.

The priority indicates how urgent this particular problem is in
relation to your work.  Note that low priority does not imply low
importance.  A priority of "high" means a solution is needed as soon as
possible.  A priority of "medium" means the problem should be solved no
later than the next release.  A priority of "low" means the problem
should be solved in a future release, but it is not important to your
work how soon this happens.  The default priority is medium.

Note that a given severity does not necessarily imply a given priority.
For example, a non-critical problem might still have a high priority if
you are faced with a hard deadline.  Conversely, a serious problem might
have a low priority if the feature it is disabling is one that you do
not need.

It is important that you fill in the release field and tell us what
changes you have made, if any.

If the `krb5-send-pr' program does not work for you, or if you did not
get far enough in the process to have an installed and working
`krb5-send-pr', you can generate your own form, using the above as an
