<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
     kpasswd - change a user's Kerberos password


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     <B>kpasswd</B> [<I>principal</I>]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <I>kpasswd</I> command is used to change a Kerberos principal's
     password.   <I>Kpasswd</I>  prompts  for the current Kerberos pass-
     word, which is used to obtain a <B>changepw</B> ticket from the KDC
     for  the  user's  Kerberos  realm.   If <B>kpasswd</B> successfully
     obtains the <B>changepw</B> ticket, the user is prompted twice  for
     the new password, and the password is changed.

     If the principal is governed by a policy that specifies  the
     length  and/or  number  of character classes required in the
     new password, the new password must conform to  the  policy.
     (The  five  character  classes  are  lower case, upper case,
     numbers, punctuation, and all other characters.)

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <I>principal</I>
          change the password for the Kerberos principal  <I>princi-</I>
          <I>pal</I>.   Otherwise,  <I>kpasswd</I> uses the principal name from
          an existing ccache if there is one; if not, the princi-
          pal  is  derived from the identity of the user invoking
          the <I>kpasswd</I> command.


</PRE>
<H2>PORTS</H2><PRE>
     <B>kpasswd</B> looks first for kpasswd_server =  host:port  in  the
     [realms]  section  of  the  krb5.conf file under the current
     realm.   If  that  is  missing,  <B>kpasswd</B>   looks   for   the
     admin_server entry, but substitutes 464 for the port.

</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
     <B>kpasswd</B> may not work with multi-homed hosts running  on  the
     Solaris platform.
