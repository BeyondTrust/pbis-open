1. In case you want to update registry settings upon product upgrade, add the
   following code to build/products/install.sh, fix_old_registry function:

    # Add nfs3
    local FOUND=""
    local DRIVER_NAME="nfs3"
    local DRIVERS=`${PREFIX}/bin/lwregshell list_values '[HKEY_THIS_MACHINE\Services\lwio\Parameters\Drivers]' 'Load' | /usr/bin/perl -nle '@a=split(/[," ]+/); print "@a[3..1000]";'`

    for d in $DRIVERS ; do
        if [ "$d" == "$DRIVER_NAME" ] ; then
            FOUND="TRUE"
        fi
    done

    if [ "$FOUND" != "TRUE" ] ; then
        DRIVERS="$DRIVERS $DRIVER_NAME"
    fi

    DRIVERS=`echo $DRIVERS | sed 's/ /,/g'`

    ${PREFIX}/bin/lwregshell set_value '[HKEY_THIS_MACHINE\Services\lwio\Parameters\Drivers]' 'Load' "$DRIVERS"


2. The driver is not a part of lwiso product.  You'll have to add it manually, probably by editing some files in build/products/lwiso/
