Autoconf was originally written by David MacKenzie, with help from
Franc,ois Pinard, Karl Berry, Richard Pixley, Ian Lance Taylor, Roland
McGrath, Noah Friedman, david d zuhn, and many others.

Ben Elliston next took over the maintenance, facing a huge Autoconf
backlog that had been piling up since the departure of David.

Today, there are no less than five maintainers: Akim Demaille, Paul
Eggert, Jim Meyering, Alexandre Oliva, and Tom Tromey, especially
helped by Lars J. Aas, Mo DeJong, Steven G. Johnson, Matthew
D. Langston, Pavel Roskin, and many others listed in the THANKS file.
