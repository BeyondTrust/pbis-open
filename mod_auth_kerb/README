Mod_auth_kerb (http://modauthkerb.sourceforge.net/) is an Apache module
designed to provide Kerberos authentication to the Apache web server. Using the
Basic Auth mechanism, it retrieves a username/password pair from the browser
and checks them against a Kerberos server as set up by your particular
organization. The module also supports the Negotiate authentication method,
which performs full Kerberos authentication based on ticket exchanges, and does
not require users to insert their passwords to the browser. In order to use the
Negotiate method you need a browser supporting it (currently standard IE6.0 or
Mozilla with the negotiateauth extension (http://negotiateauth.mozdev.org/).

The module supports both kerberos4 and kerberos5 protocols for password
verification. The Negotiate mechanism can be only used with Kerberos v5. The
module supports both 1.x and 2.x versions of Apache.

If you are using the Basic Auth mechanism, the module does not do any special
encryption of any sort. The passing of the username and password is done with
the same Base64 encoding that Basic Auth uses. This can easily be converted to
plain text. To counter this, I would suggest also using mod_ssl or Apache-SSL.
The use of SSL encryption is also recommended if you are using the Negotiate
method.

When password based authentication for Kerberos is used, via the Basic Auth 
mechanism, the incoming user name is mapped to a Kerberos principal name. 
The user may provide the logon credentials in one of the following formats
    <REALM>\<user> or <user>@<REALM> or just <user>.
The mapping can be controlled by a regular expression in the Kerberos 
configuration file (usually /etc/krb5.conf) under the appdefaults section 
as shown below. The mappings parameter takes a space separated list of
"<regular expression> <target>" pairs where the matching entries from the 
<regular expression> are substituted in the <target> for the $1, $2, $3 ... 
placeholders.
Similar to the mappings parameter is the reverse_mappings parameter. It maps 
the Kerberos principal name of the authenticated user back to the user in the
HTTP request.

[appdefaults]
    httpd = {
        mappings = SOMEDOMAIN\\(.*) $1@SOMEDOMAIN.SUFFIX.COM
        reverse_mappings = (.*)@SOMEDOMAIN\.SUFFIX\.COM SOMEDOMAIN\$1
    }


Building and installing the module
----------------------------------
see INSTALL

Summary of Supported Directives
-------------------------------

AuthType type
   For Kerberos authentication to work, AuthType must be set to 'Kerberos'. For
   the reasons of backwards compatibility the values KerberosV4 and KerberosV5
   are also supported. Their use is not recommended though, for finer setting
   use following three options.

KrbMethodNegotiate on | off	(set to on by default)
   To enable or disable the use of the Negotiate method. You need a special
   support on the browser side to support this mechanism.

KrbMethodK5Passwd on | off	(set to on by default)
   To enable or disable the use of password based authentication for Kerberos
   v5.

KrbMethodK4Passwd on | off 	(set to on by default)
   To enable or disable the use of password based authentication for Kerberos
   v4.

KrbAuthoritative on | off	(set to on by default)
   If set to off this directive allow authentication controls to be pass on to
   another modules. Use only if you really know what you are doing.

KrbAuthRealms realm1 [realm2 ... realmN]
   This option takes one or more arguments (separated by spaces), specifying
   the Kerberos realm(s) to be used for authentication. This defaults to the
   default realm taken from the local Kerberos configuration.

KrbVerifyKDC on | off		(set to on by default)
   This option can be used to disable the verification tickets against local
   keytab to prevent KDC spoofing atacks. It should be used only for testing
   purposes. You have been warned.

KrbServiceName server_principal
   Specifies a principal name to use by Apache when authenticating the clients.
   By default value of the form
   	HTTP/<FQDN_of_apache>@<realm>
   is used. The FQDN part can contain any hostname and can be used to work
   around problems with misconfigured DNS. A corresponding key of this name
   must be stored in the keytab.

Krb4Srvtab /path/to/srvtab
   This option takes one argument, specifying the path to the Kerberos V4
   srvtab. It will simply use the "default srvtab" from Kerberos V4's
   configuration if this option is not specified. The srvtab must be readable
   for the apache process, and should be different from srvtabs containing keys
   for other services.

Krb5Keytab /path/to/keytab
   This option takes one argument, specifying the location of the Kerberos V5
   keytab file. It will use the "default keytab" from Kerberos V5's config if
   it is not specified here. The keytab file must be readable for the apache
   process, and should be different from other keytabs in the system.

KrbSaveCredentials on | off	(set to off by default)
   This option enables credential saving functionality.

KrbDelegateBasic on | off       (set to off by default)
   If set to 'on' this options causes that Basic authentication is always
   offered regardless setting the KrbMethodK[45]Pass directives. Then, if 
   a Basic authentication header arrives authentication decision is passed
   along to another modules. This option is a work-around for insufficient
   authentication scheme in Apache (Apache 2.1 seems to provide better support
   for multiple various authentication mechanisms).

Note on server principals
-------------------------
Now you have to create an service key for the module, which is needed to
perform client authentication. Verification of the kerberos password has two
steps. In the first one the KDC is contacted using the password trying to
receive a ticket for the client. After this ticket is sucessfuly acquired, the
module must also verify that KDC hasn't been deliberately faked and the ticket
just received can be trusted. If this check would haven't been done any
attacker capable of spoofing the KDC could impersonate any principal registered
with the KDC. In order to do this check the apache module must verify that the
KDC knows its service key, which the apache shares with the KDC. This service
key must be created during configuration the module. This service key is also
needed when the Negotiate method is used. In this case the module acts as a
standard kerberos service (similarly to e.g. kerberized ssh or ftp servers).
Default name of the service key is HTTP/<fqdn_of_www_server>@REALM, another
name of the first instance can be set using the KrbServiceName option. The key
must be stored in a keytab on a local disk, the Krb5Keytab and Krb4Srvtab
options are used to specify the filename with the keytab. This file should be
only readable for the apache process and contain only the key used for www
authentication.

Ticket File/Credential Cache Saving
-----------------------------------
Sometimes there is need to keep the ticket file or credential cache around
after a user authenticates, normally for cgi scripts. If you turn on
KrbSaveCredentials, the tickets will be retrieved into a ticket file or
credential cache that will be available for the request handler. The ticket
file will be removed after request is handled.
