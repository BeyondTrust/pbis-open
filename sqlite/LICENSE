The following license information has been copied directly from
http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html

    All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
    domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the
    companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their 
    contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed
    affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci.
    Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute
    the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled
    binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

    The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite - those
    parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger
    application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as part of the
    build process might fall under other licenses. The details here are unclear.
    We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and build code so
    much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite
    library.

    All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No
    code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every
    line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those
    authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base
    is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
